      <P>Version 7.0.2 of Macromedia Director brings many great new features, 
      like faster playback, more sprite channels, and dot syntax. Unfortunately, 
      in order to get these new features in, it seems that some of the older 
      features of Director have been somewhat neglected. Aside from a couple of 
      new additions, text in Director hasn't changed much in the past few 
      iterations of Director. Since text is as important a content type as sound 
      and graphics, it can be quite frustrating to use Director's limited text 
      fields within the whiz-bang interface you just designed. 
      <P>Fortunately, Macromedia has provided an alternative. A new feature of 
      Flash 4 is the ability to create text entry fields. Since Director 7.0.2 
      can import Flash 4 assets, you can now use these fields in Director. 
      Though Flash asset performance is not much better than the built-in text 
      options, there are some significant advantages to using it. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fonts</FONT></H4>
      <P>The 7.0.2 Read Me file states, "On the Macintosh, a small percentage of 
      postscript fonts either fail to compress or render incorrectly." 
      Fortunately, Flash does not seem to share these problems. Every PostScript 
      font that I have imported into Flash looks the same as it would in 
      Illustrator or Photoshop. 
      <P>Because Flash treats text as vector art, your Flash sprites can be 
      scaled in Director without worrying about font sizes. One downside to 
      Flash text is that it looks blurry at small point sizes, due to the 
      anti-aliasing of the Flash member. The anti-aliasing can be turned off, by 
      selecting the Low Quality setting in the Cast Member Properties dialog 
      box, but your text will probably be illegible as a result. 
      <P>Because font information is stored as part of the Flash asset, you only 
      have to manage one cast member, instead of one field and one font member. 
      In fact, you can set up one or multiple forms in a Flash movie and have it 
      only take up a single cast member in Director. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Extra 
      Features</FONT></H4>
      <P>With Director's Text and Field members, many simple functions require 
      considerable Lingo scripting. This is not so with Flash. You can easily 
      make password fields and limit the number of characters that can be typed 
      into a field. However, Flash can be much more limited in terms of more 
      advanced functionality. 
      <P>Take a look at Flash's Text <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/UD_articles/UD84.html#fieldprops">Field 
      Properties dialog</A> for ideas on how you can use it for features that 
      Director's text and field members don't provide. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Performance</FONT></H4>
      <P>Flash performance can be pretty slow in some cases. Here are a couple 
      of tips to speed things up: 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The "Static" 
      Property</B></FONT> 
      <P>Flash members have a "static" property, which is not accessible via the 
      Cast Member Properties dialog box. If you have a Flash member that doesn't 
      require user input or animation, you can tell Director that the graphics 
      of the member will not change. This makes a tremendous difference in the 
      frame rate of movies that use Flash members. You can change the static 
      property in a couple of different ways: 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Method 1:</FONT> 
      <P>Open a Director movie with a Flash asset in it. Assuming that the Flash 
      member was member 1, you would type in the message window: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).static = TRUE</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Save your movie. The property change will be saved with it. 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Method 2:</FONT> 
      <P>If you have a Flash member that you want to change in some sections of 
      your movie but not in others, you can attach the following behavior to the 
      sprites that will not change: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on beginSprite me
   sprite(the CurrentSpriteNum).static = TRUE
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Cast Member Properties 
      Dialog Box Settings</B></FONT> 
      <P>Different Flash members will require different optimization settings 
      within the Cast Member Properties dialog box. You should play around with 
      these settings until you find the optimum settings for your asset. 
      <P>The settings that have made the biggest difference for me on my 
      projects are the Direct to Stage and Tempo settings. If you have an asset 
      that you know you won't be using special ink modes or layering effects 
      with, go ahead and check the Direct to Stage box. The Tempo setting I 
      usually use is Lock-Step. This forces Director to ignore the Flash asset's 
      tempo and only update the Flash graphics when it updates the next Director 
      frame. Since Director only has to redraw that portion of the screen once 
      per frame instead of several times per frame, Flash doesn't impact 
      Director's performance as much. Other settings I change from the defaults 
      are Sound (OFF) and Paused (ON). 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Director Tempo 
      Settings</B></FONT> 
      <P>If you don't have animation that needs a specific frame rate, then 
      crank up the frame rate in the sections of your movie that use vector art. 
      This forces Director to update the stage more often, including your Flash 
      members. This will result in faster response time when typing text into 
      editable Flash fields. If you have Lingo based animation that executes on 
      every exitFrame event, then your animation will be updated more often as 
      well. 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Other Performance 
      Boosts</B></FONT>

      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Create a 
      Username/Password Dialog Box </FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT color=#cc0000>with (Almost) no Lingo!</FONT> 
      <P>For a test project, let's make a simple username/password field using 
      Director and Flash. 
      <P>Launch Flash 4 and create a new project. Go to the Modify: Movie menu 
      to set up the initial properties of your project. For my example, I am 
      sticking with a white background, so the Flash member can be set to 
      Background Transparent ink within Director. Set the dimensions of your 
      project just big enough to hold your fields. For my file, I used a width 
      of 200 and height of 100. Once you have set up the properties, close the 
      dialog box. 
      <P>Select the Text Tool and click and drag to create your username field 
      in the Flash workspace. Use the settings on the Tool Palette to select 
      your desired font properties for the field. Click the Text Field icon at 
      the bottom of the Tool Palette. This makes all the cool features of Flash 
      text fields available to you. To access these features, select Modify: 
      Text Field (Note that the text fields in the included Flash movie 
      userPass.fla have been turned into symbols. If you want to edit the Text 
      Field proeprties you will need to edit the symbol and then access the Text 
      Field properties). 
      <P>The first thing that you will want to do in the Text Field Properties 
      dialog box is to give the field a variable name. This is the variable name 
      that you will be accessing from Director. I am calling mine "vUser." I 
      then set the Maximum Length setting to 15 characters. 
      <P>I only want the user to be able to type alphanumeric characters into 
      the username field, so I trick Flash into limiting the user input by 
      selecting the "Include only specified font outlines" option, and then 
      checking only the "Uppercase", "Lowercase", and "Numbers" checkboxes. When 
      the movie is run, the field will not respond to characters that it does 
      not have an outline for. (Note: Password fields only display the asterisk 
      character, so you can't trick Flash into not accepting that character as 
      input). Also be aware that Flash is smart enough to borrow outlines from 
      other fields, so if you want to use this trick, use a different font for 
      fields that you want to limit the input for.) 
      <P>Your settings should look like those in the screen shot below: 
      <P><A name=fieldprops></A><IMG alt="" border=0 height=411 
      src="UD84_files/UD84_textfieldprops.gif" width=485> 
      <P>Once you have your text field properties set, click "OK" to exit the 
      dialog box. 
      <P>Instead of starting from scratch with our password field, I 
      Option(Mac)/Alt(Win)-Click-Shift-drag down to make a duplicate of the 
      username field underneath the first field. If you are using the trick 
      above to limit the text entered into the username field, don't forget to 
      select a different font for the password field at this point. 
      <P>Once again, select Modify: Text Field to edit the new field. I set the 
      variable name to "vPass." Check the "Password" box so that the field won't 
      show the actual text being typed. Since the password field displays 
      asterisks instead of the actual characters being typed, you need to add 
      that outline to the set of included outlines. Select the "Characters" 
      checkbox and type an asterisk ("*") into the Characters field. Click OK to 
      accept the changes. 
      <P>Director can only access the variables we just created if they exist 
      within a Flash symbol. With the password field still selected, select 
      Insert: Convert to Symbol. Give your symbol any name and click OK. Select 
      the username field and do the same thing. 
      <P>We're over halfway there! Save your work file in case you need to go 
      back to it later, and then export your .SWF file from the File: Export 
      Movie menu (the default export settings are fine). 
      <P>Launch Director 7.0.2 and import your .SWF file. If you want, you can 
      use any of the tips listed in the Performance section to speed up your 
      Flash movie (except the "static" property). Drag the Flash member to 
      sprite channel 1, and set the sprite's ink to "Background Transparent". If 
      you don't like the size of the asset, just grab a corner and drag to make 
      it bigger. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=288 src="UD84_files/UD84_memberprops.gif" 
      width=485> 
      <P>Go ahead and double-click the Frame Script channel above the Flash 
      sprite, and type in a behavior to have Director loop on the current frame: 
<PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on exitFrame
   go to the frame
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Select the Push Button tool on the Tool Palette. Click and drag on the 
      stage to create a button to submit our username and password information. 
      Click inside the button you just created and type SUBMIT. Select the new 
      button member in the cast, and click the Cast Member Script button to edit 
      the script of the button. 
      <P>To get our variable data from Flash, we will be using the "getVariable" 
      function that Macromedia forgot to document in version 7.0.2. Type in the 
      following script for the button: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on mouseUp
   vText = "Username:" &amp;&amp; sprite(1).getVariable("vUser") &amp; RETURN
   vText = vText &amp; "Password:" &amp;&amp; sprite(1).getVariable("vPass")
   alert vText
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Note that you can also use the method "setVariable" to change text 
      within a Flash asset. The syntax is: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>setVariable(sprite spriteNum, variableName, Value)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Or in dot syntax: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>sprite(spriteNum).setVariable(variableName, Value)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You're done! Open up the message window and play back your movie to 
      view your handiwork. Your file should look something like the following: 
      <P>
      <OBJECT classid=clsid:166B1BCA-3F9C-11CF-8075-444553540000

      <P>Note that one downside to using Flash forms in Director is that they 
      seem to ignore the Tab key when trying to switch from one field to 
      another.
