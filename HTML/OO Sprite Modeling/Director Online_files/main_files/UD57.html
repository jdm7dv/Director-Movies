      <P>As a development environment, Director offers two very different 
      approaches to authoring a multimedia piece. Non-programmers can use the 
      score as a graphical layout mechanism by which screens can be dropped into 
      place rather simply. On the other side of the spectrum are people who 
      approach development from a programming standpoint. The goal of this 
      article is to offer insight and actual techniques that the Object Oriented 
      Director developer can use to allow these two approaches to work together 
      in a flexible and robust manner. I will present to you the theory and 
      Lingo code needed for you to design objects that manifest themselves 
      dynamically in the score at runtime, and are equally as responsive to 
      Director events (mouseDown, enterFrame etc.) as sprites which are 
      physically placed on the score in authoring mode. The level of control you 
      get as a Lingo programmer using these techniques should hopefully open 
      your eyes to a whole new level of Director development. This article will 
      cover the following topics : 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Dynamically allocated sprite channels and the steps needed to 
        implement them. 
        <LI>Modeling the Director Sprite as a Lingo class (Parent Script). 
        <LI>Specialization and reuse of the Sprite class through Inheritance. 
        <LI>Allowing Director events and your virtual sprite objects to 
        communicate in real-time. </LI></OL>
      <P>I will present some background information which will help you better 
      understand how such an approach can facilitate your development efforts 
      and tie it all together with a demo Director movie which illustrates an 
      actual implementation of these techniques. From there it is up to you and 
      your imagination to fully exploit the potential of what is presented here. 

      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</FONT></H4>
      <P>The "one-frame movie" is a Director movie in which Lingo is the driving 
      force behind what the user sees and interacts with on the screen. It's a 
      movie in which all activity takes place in a single frame on the Director 
      score. While standard procedural scripting can be used to make most any 
      desired action happen, as Object Oriented developers, we strive to design 
      an approach to our development such that our efforts can be reused and 
      minimized at the same time. As a developer of a "one frame movie", you are 
      faced with the task of programmatically implementing everything that is to 
      happen on screen and between the system and the user. As a "code minded" 
      developer, I find that I like to have complete control. 
      <P>However, it is very important to remain flexible in your development 
      process, whichever side you are approaching it from. It is important for 
      the "code minded" developer to understand that the potential offered by 
      the score as a layout mechanism is enormous. It is counterproductive to 
      abandon the potential offered by the score simply out of the purist 
      mindset. Artists can use the powerful graphical layout and animation 
      capabilities for those elements of a multimedia piece which are static. 
      Lingo developers may be faced with the task of programmatically "bringing 
      to life" an artist's score based representation. In such a scenario, it is 
      important that we design code that is robust, yet flexible enough to work 
      with those static elements that naturally change throughout the 
      development process. 
      <P>Lingo programmers often need to implement things like rollover 
      tool-tips, pop-up menus, animated run-time characters and other such 
      bullets, bombs, monsters and mazes so prevalent in the wide range of 
      applications that are possible with Director. In data- driven 
      environments, often a static interface will be "brought to life" when 
      search results, user input etc., are dynamically represented graphically. 
      What we want to avoid when developing such applications is the need to 
      hard-code sprite channels, frame-numbers, cast members etc., in our 
      efforts to work around any static, score-based interface elements which 
      already exist. The importance of such flexibility is compounded in a team 
      based development environment. 
      <P>Any OOP purist will understand that a GUI and other such dynamic 
      graphic representations must exist as a separate "layer" in a software 
      design from the code and logic which drives the piece. Reliance on 
      procedural and often hard-coded solutions when working with an interface 
      and dynamic content, especially for larger projects, is analogous to 
      hitting yourself over the head with a sledge-hammer, repeatedly, for 
      months on end only to be left with code that is difficult to maintain, and 
      not very portable. Not to mention a pretty bad headache! So where does 
      this leave us? Well, unless you've got a lifetime supply of headache 
      medicine, you'll probably want to take a more structured approach to the 
      Lingo side of things. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dynamically 
      allocated sprite channels</FONT></H4>
      <P>Consider for a moment the standard way of placing media on the score. 
      We know that empty sprite channels are unresponsive to Director events 
      such as mouseUp and mouseDown. As soon as you drop a media element into a 
      sprite channel, you have essentially placed an object on the stage which 
      is able to trap the standard set of Director events if you script it to do 
      so. Notice also that if you drag a cast member from the cast window to the 
      stage, Director automatically places this cast member into the next 
      available sprite channel; as well, you have the option of dragging a cast 
      member into a specific sprite channel. Still at this point, the new sprite 
      will not respond to events unless it is scripted to do so. 
      <P>This is accomplished by placing a behavior on the sprite. For example, 
      if you wanted your new sprite to be able to change its cast member on 
      mouseEnter (ie, for a button rollover), you could drag the "UI Rollover 
      Change Member" behavior from the Director Behavior Library onto your new 
      sprite to give it this functionality. Remember that what I am describing 
      here is the allocation of a sprite and its behavior during authoring mode 
      and is a straightforward process that we are all familiar with. In order 
      to make this type of functionality dynamic such that it can happen at 
      run-time we need to prepare the unused sprite channels in our score to 
      mimic the action of manually dropping a cast member onto the stage in 
      authoring mode. This requires two steps : 
      <OL>
        <LI>Using a placeholder cast member in each unused sprite channel 
        <LI>Using a "Sprite Allocation" behavior on each placeholder. </LI></OL>
      <P>For a placeholder, I use a 1 pixel x 1 pixel cast member, created by 
      opening the paint window and using the pencil tool to draw a single dot. I 
      then place one of these in each unused sprite channel. At this point all 
      you have is a score full of placeholders and any previously existing 
      static interface elements. The Sprite Allocation behavior gives this set 
      of placeholder sprites the following abilities : 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Dynamic allocation of a channel to a "Lingo Sprite Object" 
        <LI>The ability to trap for Director events, which can then be forwarded 
        to a "Lingo Sprite Object" </LI></OL>
      <P>By "Lingo Sprite Object" I'm generically referring to instances of the 
      sprite class, which will be discussed shortly. For now assume there exists 
      a Lingo object that can somehow "attach" itself to any given placeholder 
      sprite. 
      <H3><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sprite 
      Allocation Behavior</FONT></H3>
      <P>Based on the above discussion of how sprites are allocated and given 
      behavior manually in authoring mode, it can be said that a behavior used 
      to mimic such functionality at runtime should be able to perform the 
      following tasks dynamically : 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Know its "state" - i.e. whether it is currently in use or not. 
        <LI>Be able to set itself back to its "placeholder state" when no longer 
        in use. 
        <LI>Be able to decide if it is the next available dynamic sprite in the 
        score. 
        <LI>Be able to trap Director events, and forward them to the appropriate 
        "Lingo Sprite Object". </LI></OL>
      <P>This set of functionality is exactly what the Sprite Allocation 
      behavior is responsible for implementing. The actual behavior is included 
      in the demo available at the end of this article. The Sprite Allocation 
      behavior has the following properties : 
      <P><B>pOriginMember</B> - stores the "placeholder" cast member 
      name<BR><B>pOriginRect</B> - stores the original rect value of the 
      placeholder sprite<BR><B>pSpriteNum</B> - stores the spriteNum for the 
      channel where the behavior is.<BR><B>pSpriteObjectRef</B> - stores a 
      pointer to the "Lingo Sprite Object" <BR><B>pEmpty</B> - the "in use 
      state" of the sprite channel (true or false) 
      <P>As well, this behavior has the following methods : <PRE><B>mReset</B> me
<B>mFindNextEmptySprite</B> me, dReturnList, dSpriteObjectRef
<B>mSetSpriteObjectRef</B> me, dNewRef
<B>mouseUp</B> me
<B>mouseDown</B> me
<B>mouseEnter</B> me
<B>mouseLeave</B> me
<B>mouseUpOutside</B> me
<B>rightMouseUp</B> me
<B>rightMouseDown</B> me
<B>enterFrame</B> me
<B>exitFrame</B> me
<B>prepareFrame</B> me</PRE>
      <P>The method mReset is responsible for setting the member, rect and 
      checked out status properties back to their defaults. Generally the 
      default rect value for a placeholder is something offstage, such as 
      rect(-1000, 0, -999, 1). 
      <P>Polling the frame for the next available dynamic sprite channel and 
      "checking it out" is accomplished by the mFindNextEmptySprite method: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on mFindNextEmptySprite  me, dReturnList, dSpriteObjectRef
  if count(dReturnList) then exit
  if pEmpty then
    add dReturnList, pSpriteNum
    set pEmpty to FALSE
    set pSpriteObjectRef = dSpriteObjectRef
  end if
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This method may not be self-explanatory now, but we'll discuss how it 
      does what it does later in the article. 
      <P>You'll notice that each of the sprite and frame Director events is 
      implemented within this behavior. This allows the sprite to trap for these 
      events. This begs the question, how do we know what is supposed to be 
      implemented within each of these methods if the sprites are generic? We 
      can't tell if the sprite will be taken over by a pop-up field, or a game 
      piece or a tool-tip at runtime. As such, it only makes sense that we can't 
      have any specific implementation details within these methods. All they 
      are responsible for is forwarding the event into the "Lingo Sprite Object" 
      which has taken over the dynamic sprite channel. The Sprite Allocation 
      behavior must have the property pSpriteObjectRef - so that it knows where 
      to forward the event to. 
      <P>At this point we have discussed the purposes of the Sprite Allocation 
      behavior and how it works. What I have yet to discuss is what exactly this 
      generic "Lingo Sprite Object" is. All we know at this point is that it is 
      an object that can take over a sprite channel. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sprite 
      Class</FONT></H4>
      <P>When you consider all the various types of media that can be placed on 
      the score, you might think of anything from a Bitmap or a Field, to a 
      FilmLoop or a Digital Video clip. While each of these media types are very 
      different in their representations and their functionality, the 
      commonality between them all is that they are all Sprites. Director 
      implements a Sprite as a "built in" object. It exists on the stage in a 
      given frame or range of frames. In order to gain complete control as a 
      programmer, wouldn't it be nice to have a virtual representation of 
      various sprite types that can be given properties, saved to files and 
      exist across any frame or movie? Such objects give the programmer any 
      level of control and no longer rely on a physical attachment to the score 
      to exist, be modified or retain their state. Before considering specific 
      types of sprites, we should abstract the commonalties into a single class, 
      the SPRITE class. 
      <P>The sprite class is semi-abstract in that it has properties and 
      implementations for those properties which are common to all types of 
      physical sprites. Properties like rect, width, height, member, blend, ink 
      which for the most part are common to all sprites types have properties 
      and accessor/mutator methods implemented within this root-level sprite 
      class. You'll notice in the demo code that all the "event" methods such as 
      mMouseUp for example, are deferred methods. This means they have no 
      implementation within this generic sprite class. Event methods contained 
      within the sprite class are named as "m" plus the event name to re-iterate 
      that these methods are not actual events trapped by Director. The Sprite 
      Class also has a clone() method which allows you to create a new, unique 
      instance of a given sprite object, and a stepFrame() method which allows 
      you to add your custom sprite objects to the actorList - very useful for 
      objects which have animated representations. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creating an 
      instance of the Sprite Class</FONT></H4>
      <P>To create an instance of the sprite class, we call the new() method : <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on new me,  dMember, dRect, dSpriteToUse
  -- dSPriteToUse is optional
  set pMember  to value(dMember)
  set pRect to value(dRect)
  if not(voidP(dSpriteToUse)) then
    set pSpriteNum = dSpriteTouse
    sendSprite(pSpriteNum, #mCheckOut, me)
  end if
  return me
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Pay particular attention to what is happening within this constructor 
      method. First of all, in order to create an instance of this virtual 
      sprite, it should be given a member and a rect as arguments. Essentially 
      this mimics dragging a cast member onto the stage. The thing to keep in 
      mind is that instances of class sprite represent virtual sprites, i.e. 
      they do not have to exist on the stage at any given time. However, to 
      model the fact that you have the option to drag a cast member into a 
      specific sprite channel, an optional argument dSpriteToUse can be used to 
      specify which physical sprite this object should manifest itself in. 
      <P>If a value is passed for dSpriteToUse, a broadcast message is sent to 
      that sprite to check it out (as opposed to polling the frame for the next 
      available channel). Generally though you'll be creating a new instance 
      without passing in a specific sprite channel to use. I find the ability to 
      specify a sprite channel helpful for implementing things like tool- tips, 
      that should, for example, use the top-most channel. 
      <P>At this point, we have created a virtual representation of a sprite, 
      capable of knowing values for properties such as rect, member, ink etc. In 
      order to physically manifest this virtual sprite on the stage, we must 
      call mDisplay() : <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on mDisplay me
  if voidP(pSpriteNum) then
    set dNewSprite = createRealSprite(me, pMember, pRect)
    set pSpriteNum = dNewSprite
  end if
  mUpdate me
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Within this method, if the object's pSpriteNum property is not void, a 
      call to createRealSprite() is made. The createRealSprite method is used as 
      follows within the "Lingo Sprite Object" to manifest itself on the score: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on createRealSprite me, dMember, dRect
  set collectionList to []
  sendAllSprites (#mFindNextEmptySprite, collectionList, me)
  if count(collectionList) = 0 then
    -- there are no more available dynamic sprite channels
    set dNewSprite = 0
  else 
    set dNewSprite to getAt(collectionList, 1)
  end if
  return dNewSprite
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This uses the technique presented on Direct-L by John Dowdell. Since 
      sendAllSprites cannot be used as a function (i.e. it does not return a 
      value), we are passing a list reference to all the sprites. Within 
      mFindNextEmptySprite, you'll notice that if dReturnList contains any 
      values, the method is exited, as a value in the dReturnList means an empty 
      sprite channel has already been found. Simply put, a broadcast message to 
      all sprites in the current frame results in the first one with pEmpty = 
      true checking itself out and setting its pSpriteObjectRef to the object 
      that executed the broadcast event. That object is then aware of which 
      sprite channel it has manifested itself in. 
      <P>The final call to mUpdate()iterates through the properties contained 
      within the sprite class and sets the physical sprite properties 
      accordingly. This is followed by a call to updateStage. Calling the sprite 
      objects mReset() method clears the sprite objects internal properties and 
      sends a message to the in-use sprite channel to reset itself, making it 
      available for use by another object. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Specialization 
      of the Sprite Class</FONT></H4>
      <P>With the sprite class alone, we can create a virtual sprite 
      representation for most media types. What really makes this approach 
      powerful is the ability to use Inheritance to create sub-classes which use 
      the generic sprite class as their ancestor. This isn't simply so that we 
      can differentiate media types, although doing so can be useful if it is 
      appropriate. For almost any dynamic application, "things" created on 
      screen will have some type of interaction with the user. Maybe you are 
      creating a game in which you have 5 different enemy types, each one with a 
      different look and feel, and a different response to a mouse click. Be it 
      an "enemy", a "bomb", a "pop-up text box" or a "tool-tip" - these objects 
      are all specialized versions of a sprite, and it is within these 
      specialized event methods that specific implementation details exist. For 
      example, to create a "health" item for a game, you might do something like 
      the following: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>--parent script "health"
property ancestor, pPoints
on new me
  set ancestor = new(script "classSprite", (member ¬
    "healthIcon"), rect(10,10,100,100))
  mDisplay(me)
end

on mMouseDown me
-- award somebody heath, etc.. anything!
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>It is within the sub-classes of sprite that specific event details are 
      implemented. Because this virtual sprite object is referenced directly by 
      the behavior in the physical placeholder sprite in which it was 
      manifested, mouse-events and frame-events can be passed directly into this 
      specific implementation, and nothing has been hardwired to an author-time 
      score. This messaging pathway is illustrated in the following diagram : 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=300 src="UD57_files/UD57.gif" width=300> 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conclusion</FONT></H4>
      <P>The demo included with this article contains all the source code you 
      need to implement sprite objects and the Sprite Allocation behavior. The 
      demo illustrates sub- classing of the sprite class with the 
      "classGenericCharacter" parent script, and then further sub- classing to 
      create unique character implementations. These various types of characters 
      are dynamically created and moved around the screen using the techniques 
      presented here. Clicking on any given character causes a unique alert to 
      appear. Although this demo is fairly simplistic, with it, you'll see an 
      actual implementation of the sprite class working in conjunction with the 
      Sprite Allocation behavior to dynamically allocate sprite channels. 
      <P>You will notice that the dynamic manifestations of these Lingo objects 
      as run- time sprites are equally as responsive to mouse/frame events as 
      any static sprite which you can place on the score and assign behaviors to 
      in authoring mode. You'll be pleased to see how easy and straightforward 
      the code really is. Note that all scripts in the demo are heavily 
      commented, so take time to read them and understand how the internals of 
      the code work. The sprite class is a fine example of a completely reusable 
      Lingo component. As I stated earlier, the potential uses for these 
      techniques are limited only by your imagination. I guarantee you the 
      possibilities are limitless, as I continue to find new applications of 
      these techniques in my Director development every day.
