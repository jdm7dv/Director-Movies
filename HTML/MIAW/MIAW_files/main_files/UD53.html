      <P>A question that has arisen several times over the past few months on 
      the Lingo-L mailing list has to do with creating a MIAW 
      (Movie-In-A-Window) that has the following properties: 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>It does not have a standard title-bar 
        <LI>It can be dragged around by the user both within AND outside the 
        stage bounds of a windowed projector. </LI></OL>
      <P>It seems simple enough. What most developers find is that given the 
      range of windowType values available, the MIAW ends up with a title-bar 
      and is only moveable within the confines of the stage, or it has no 
      title-bar, sits within the confines of the stage and cannot be dragged 
      around at all. As a Director developer, you either have never needed this 
      type of functionality (and therefore don't realize that it's not as 
      straightforward as picking the appropriate windowType) or you have banged 
      your head against the wall trying to figure out which windowType to use to 
      get the desired results. Bang your heads no longer, the answer is here and 
      is very easy to implement in your own Director applications. The technique 
      presented here has been tested and works equally well on both MAC and PC. 
      <P>So how can this be accomplished? The process is actually quite simple 
      and really involves only two steps: 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Use the appropriate windowType value, in this case, the MIAW must 
        have a windowType = 2 
        <LI>Attach the appropriate Lingo code to a "fake" title-bar within the 
        MIAW that interacts with the mouse allowing the MIAW to be dragged 
        around. </LI></OL>
      <P>Why must the MIAW have a windowType = 2? In a nutshell, a type-2 window 
      is not actually a window at all - it's really a dialog box. Actual windows 
      (the other windowType values available to you in Director) must exist 
      within the boundaries of the "parent" window - in this case, the stage. 
      This is not functionality unique to Director, it is a fundamental concept 
      behind all windowed operating systems. By using a windowType of 2, you are 
      actually making a ""Movie-In-A-Dialog" and dialog boxes can exist anywhere 
      on the desktop regardless of the size/location of the main window which 
      created it. If you can use Lingo to open a Director movie in a dialog box 
      (windowType = 2) at any desired location on the screen, it would follow 
      that you can also use Lingo to change it's location at runtime. 
      <P>So how do I do it? Basically, all you need to do now is attach the 
      appropriate Lingo code to a "hot-spot" within your MIAW which tracks the 
      position of the mouse while it is held down, and adjusts the rect of the 
      window (actually, the dialog box!) accordingly. 
      <P>The code used in this example is based on Lingo syntax for versions of 
      Director prior to 7.0 because at the time of this writing, the majority of 
      DOUG readers have not yet upgraded to Director 7.0. Also, while I always 
      am an advocate of using OOP in all Director development, this example uses 
      a single movie-level Lingo script that takes a reference to a MIAW as a 
      parameter. I have presented the technique like this so that it is 
      accessible by the widest range of developers. If you are comfortable with 
      OOP, I recommend wrapping this functionality into your MIAW class (parent 
      script), but doing so is by no means necessary. By way of acknowledgment, 
      I have modified this code slightly; however, I cannot take credit for its 
      initial writing. A fellow developer named Dower Chin is responsible for 
      writing this code the first time around. Nice work Dower. With that, on to 
      the code! Paste the following into the script window and make sure it's a 
      movie-level script. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
on DragWindow dWhichMIAW
  tell the stage
    set mPt to point(the mouseH,the mouseV)
    set origRect to the rect of dWhichMIAW
    repeat while the mouseDown
      set newPt to point(the mouseH, the mouseV)
      set deltaPt to newPt - mPt
      set newRect to offset(origRect,getAt(deltaPt,1), ¬
        getAt(deltaPt,2))
      set the rect of dWhichMIAW to newRect
      tell dWhichMIAW to updateStage
      updateStage
    end repeat
  end tell
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>As you can see, this script accepts a reference to a MIAW as a 
      parameter (dWhichMIAW ) - and as such, works with whatever MIAW that you 
      pass into it. However, the question still remains, "where do I call this 
      script from?" The answer is quite simple. The diagram below illustrates an 
      example of what your MIAW might look like. Notice how I have placed a 
      Director shape member in a location to "fake" a title-bar. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=260 src="UD53_files/UD53.gif" 
      width=300><BR><I>Figure 1.</I> 
      <P>Now, the only thing that you need to do is place the following script 
      on your "fake title bar": 
      <P><B>Script A</B> <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
global gVideoPlayer 
- the global reference to your MIAW

on mouseDown
  repeat while the mouseDown
    tell the stage to DragWindow(gVideoPlayer)
  end repeat
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>That's all you need. When you open your MIAW it will have no title-bar 
      and you can click within your "fake title-bar" and drag it anywhere on the 
      screen you like, regardless of stage size/boundaries. 
      <P>While this technique is really quite simple, the ability to create 
      floating movies that can be moved outside the stage is sure to open all 
      kinds of creative doors for you in your Director development. <FONT
