      <P>Could you tell me the simple way to join between Flash and Director 
      using button/icon?
      <P>Let's say I'm doing some animation with Flash and save it in shockwave 
      format (*.swf) and then put it in the Director cast. What is the script so 
      that when I click in certain area in that Shockwave Flash then it will go 
      to certain frame or movie.
      <P><A href="mailto:asyraq@mimos.my">Asyraq</A>
      <P>Dear Asyraq,
      <P>There are several easy steps involved in getting Flash to work with 
      Lingo. Step one is accomplished in the process of creating your Flash 
      movie. Create a Flash movie which is just big enough for your purposes. 
      For this example, I'll use the VCR buttons which are in Flash's button 
      library. I drag them onto the stage and space them evenly.
      <P><IMG height=298 alt="" src="handy112_files/flashScreen1.gif" width=341 
      border=0>
      <P>Next we need to assign an action to each of the buttons. Remember, 
      we're still working in the Flash application. Right click (or on the Mac, 
      control-click) one of the buttons and select Properties...
      <P><IMG height=265 alt="" src="handy112_files/flashScreen2.gif" width=500 
      border=0>
      <P>Click on the Actions tab, and then select GetURL from the pulldown 
      menu. (I don't know why they chose this term; it's not very intuitive, but 
      that's the way it works.) Now we have some choices to make about what to 
      enter as the GetURL parameter.
      <P>There are three different ways that we can send a message from the 
      Flash movie to Director:
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>pass a string
        <LI>specify an event (call a Lingo handler)
        <LI>make a Lingo statement directly</LI></OL>
      <P>The simplest way is to enter a word or phrase which Director will 
      accept as a string of characters. You could use the name of a frame or 
      movie, or in this example I used the name of the button. Just for clarity, 
      I used "buttonPlay" as the name of the button, rather than just "play" 
      because "play" is a Lingo keyword. It would actually be OK to use "play" 
      as a string -- it wouldn't confuse Lingo, but it might confuse me.
      <P>Assign GetURL actions to each of the other buttons, specifying the 
      respective button names, then export the single frame Flash movie as a 
      *.swf file. Now switch over to Director.
      <P>In Director, import the *.swf file into the cast. It will create a 
      single cast member which can be scaled, rotated, etc. And since Flash uses 
      vectors, this cast member will be tiny... only 6K for the entire set of 
      VCR controls, irrespective of the size on the stage. Drag the Flash member 
      onto the stage and adjust the size and position as needed. In this case, I 
      applied Background Transparent ink, but it's actually better for 
      performance if you can use Copy Ink. So, you might want to match the 
      background color before saving the movie in Flash.
      <P>

      <P>Sample movies (and the necessary Flash files) are available for 
      download in <A

      or <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/handy_articles/handy112/handy112Files.zip">PC</A> 
      format. These are D7 movies.
      <P>The buttons in the Flash member will send a string message when they're 
      pressed. But we need a Lingo behavior to accept and process that message. 
      Remember that the message coming from the Flash member is a "getURL" 
      message? That's the name of the handler we'll need to write in Lingo. 
      Here's the behavior to attach to the VCR buttons sprite.
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
on getURL me, flashString   
  -- do whatever with the flashString  
  member("display").text = flashString
end getURL
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>There's only one handler in the behavior: getURL. The button's name 
      gets passed to the handler as a parameter which I've called flashString. 
      Inside the getURL handler you can do anything you want with the string. In 
      this case, I simply put the string into a field member called "display". 
      As another example, let's say that you want the button to take you to a 
      specific frame of the movie. In the Flash movie, you'd enter the name of 
      the frame as the getURL parameter. Then, in the Director getURL behavior, 
      you'd do this:
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
on getURL me, flashString   
  go to frame flashString
end getURL
</FONT></PRE>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>Other 
      Options</FONT></H4>
      <P>I mentioned above that there are two other ways to pass a message in 
      the getURL Action. Let's look at those now. 
      <P>

      swLiveConnect="FALSE"  swRemote="swTarget='false'"></embed> </OBJECT>
      <P>In this example, I created a separate Flash movie for each of the Flash 
      buttons which are moving you from frame to frame in the Director movie. 
      There are no behaviors on the Flash sprites at all. Instead, all of the 
      Lingo has been entered when the Flash movie was created. In Flash, when 
      you select a button and open the Properties menu, select GetURL for the 
      action and specify that you're making a Lingo statement. Enter something 
      like the following:
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
	lingo: go to frame "pageTwo"
</FONT></PRE>
      <P><IMG height=265 alt="" src="handy112_files/flashScreen3.gif" width=500 
      border=0>
      <P>Now, all of the Lingo intelligence is preprogrammed in Flash. You 
      simply import the flash movies and drag them to the stage. Sound like the 
      easiest way, right? Well, it's easy but I don't really favor this method. 
      The problem is that you don't have control when you're in Director. What 
      if you change the names of the frames you're going to? Using this 
      approach, you'd have to go back to the Flash application and change the 
      Lingo <I>there</I>. Plus, Flash doesn't have a syntax checker for your 
      Lingo. In general, I think it's a bad idea to script your Lingo in Flash.
      <P>Now let's look at the third approach, which is kind of a compromise 
      between the first two we've examined. This approach is called "specifying 
      an event"... which simply means calling a Lingo handler and providing 
      parameter data. It will require a custom behavior on the sprite in 
      Director, which will receive the handler call and process the data.
      <P>

      <P>In this example, I created a single Flash movie with the three color 
      buttons. Like before, I assign a GetURL action to each button. But in this 
      example, I enter:
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
	event: processColor "red"
</FONT></PRE>
      <P><IMG height=265 alt="" src="handy112_files/flashScreen4.gif" width=500 
      border=0>
      <P>When I import the color buttons as a single Flash cast member in 
      Director (only 2.7K), I place it on the stage and attach the following 
      behavior.
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>
on processColor me, whichColor</B> 
  case whichColor of    
	"red": newColor = rgb(255,0,0)    
	"yellow": newColor = rgb(255,204,0)    
	"green": newColor = rgb(0,153,0)  
  end case    
  sprite(2).color = newColor  
end processColor
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This behavior receives the call to the processColor handler and 
      converts the color name from a string to the rgb value. I've set it up to 
      display the color in sprite channel 2. You can see how you could create 
      custom handlers to do anything when triggered by a Flash member.
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>Don't 
      Forget</FONT></H4>
      <P>Flash members can add a lot of style to your Director movie, while 
      economizing on the file size. Using the three methods demonstrated above, 
      you'll be able to make the Flash members interact fluently with Lingo. But 
      don't forget... if you're distributing your movie as a projector, you'll 
      need to include the Flash Asset Xtra with the program. (This isn't 
      necessary for Shockwave.)
      <P>Good luck with your program.
