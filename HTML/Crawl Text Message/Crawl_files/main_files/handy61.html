            Multimedia Handyman</FONT></B> 
            <P>I am creating a multimedia resume and would like to place a 
            crawling marquee across the bottom of my Director Movie. So far, I 
            don't have a clue how to go about this. 
            <P><A href="mailto:terryb@tomrowe.com">Terry Bredemeyer</A> 
            <P>Terry, 
            <P>This is pretty easy to do. The concept is that you'll have a 
            display field that is a set number of characters (chars) wide. For 
            this example, let's say that it is 26 chars. As the message string 
            crawls across the display, what we'll be doing is deleting the first 
            char in the string (as it disappears on the left side of the 
            display) and adding a char at the end. This way, char 2 becomes char 
            1, char 3 becomes char 2, etc. 
            <P>

              </embed>               </OBJECT>
            <P>I'll write this as a movie script with several handlers, which 
            you can call from any other script simply by naming the handler and 
            supplying it with the message string and the number of chars to 
            display at a time. You will call the handler with the following 
            format: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>crawlMessage (messageString, chars)</FONT></PRE>
            <P>Since the message will repeat itself, I recommend adding some 
            spaces at the end of your message string so that there is some 
            separation before the repeat. Also, the handler assumes that you 
            have a field member named "display". 
            <P>I'm going to use a global variable called gcrawlFlag as a "flag". 
            This is simply a signal that says "time to crawl" or "time to stop". 
            By using a global variable flag, I'll be able to have an exitFrame 
            handler check that flag on every frame exit. If the flag says 
            #crawl, then the crawling code will execute. Note that exitFrame 
            handlers are usually frame scripts, but I'm putting this one in a 
            movie script. That means that it will execute -- or at least check 
            on the crawl flag -- on the exit of every frame in the movie. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>

message crawler movie script

on crawlMessage messageString, chars
  global gcrawlFlag, gLoop
  set gLoop = the number of chars in messageString ¬
    + 1
  set gcrawlFlag to #crawl
  initMessage messageString, chars
end

on stopcrawl
  global gcrawlFlag
  set gcrawlFlag to #stop
end

on initMessage messageString, chars
  global gMessage
  set endChar = chars
  set gMessage = messageString
  put char 1 to endChar of gMessage into field ¬
    "display"
end

on exitFrame
  global gcrawlFlag, gMessage, gNextChar, gLoop
  if gcrawlFlag = #crawl then
    set gNextChar = gNextChar + 1
    if gNextChar &gt; gLoop then
      set gNextChar = 0
    end if
    delete char 1 of field "display"
    put char gNextChar of gMessage after field ¬
      "display"
  end if
end
</FONT></PRE>
            <P>When you're ready to stop the crawl, simply issue the command 
            "stopCrawl". That will change the crawl flag to #stop. The exit 
            frame script will see this and will stop changing the display. Since 
            we're using an exitFrame script to generate the crawl, the tempo of 
            your movie will determine the crawl speed. 
            <P>Good luck with your project.
