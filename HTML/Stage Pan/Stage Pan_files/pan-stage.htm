Subject: Panning the stage, fast.

&gt;I know it's not exactly ground-breaking (in fact, something much like it
&gt;can be seen on the 1996 ID Magazine CD-ROM), but I'm trying to create an
&gt;interface wherein a user can navigate a space much larger than the confines
&gt;of the screen.  For example, rolling the mouse towards the top of the
&gt;screen would cause their view to pan upwards, revealing elements up there.
&gt;As they roll left, the scene pans left, and so on.

</PRE>You asked a good question which caused me to do some thinking. Based on 
some recent work, I've crafted a handler which will address part of your 
question - rapid panning of the stage. Rather than changing the positions of 
several sprites one at a time, I've approached the problem from the perspective 
of changing your "viewport" of the stage using the oft overlooked "drawRect of 
windowObject" property. You could easily adapt a version of this code to 
algorithmically change the coordinates of the drawRect using math as well. (i.e. 
set the drawRect of the stage = the drawRect of the stage + rect(-10,0,-10,0) 
would set the stage to shift left 10 pixels.) <!-- begin code fragments --------------------------------------><PRE><FONT color=#000099>

    -- An IF test would require checking both variables regardless
    -- of whether or not Hoffset was non-zero

  --  set the drawrect of the activeWindow = the rect of the activeWindow +
rect(-the left of the rect of the activeWindow, -the top of the rect of the
activeWindow, -the left of the rect of the activeWindow, -the top of the
