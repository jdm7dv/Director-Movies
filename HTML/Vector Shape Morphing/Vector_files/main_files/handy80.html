      <P>Well, I'm a French designer, I'm not a programmer, but I like to play 
      with lingo and search for new graphical solutions. I started to watch the 
      new shapes in director 7. I think it's a great thing. I started trying to 
      morphe a shape to another one (ex: a star to a heart) and it works. Then I 
      wanted a behavior for progressive morphing. Now, the problem is that I'm 
      not able to tell the morphing member "stop your morph, you're the good 
      form". Can you help? 
      <P><A href="mailto:secondi@itw.fr">Sebastiano</A> 
      <P>Credit: Sebastiano sent the code from his unsucessful attempt at the 
      behavior, much of which I have used in this answer. I have used the French 
      terms he did. 
      <P>Dear Sebastiano, 
      <P>Nice job on your attempt. You've grasped the basic idea but just need 
      some refinement. I'll recap the process required for morphing one vector 
      shape into another. (For a complete explanation of vector members, read 
      Will Turnage's <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/accessArticle2.cfm?id=313" 
      target=_blank>great article on vector shapes</A>.) 
      <P>We know that each vector shape is a drawn by connecting lines between 
      points on a list, which is called the vertexList. Since this is a list in 
      the standard sense of Lingo, there are some quick operations we can do to 
      an entire list. For example... <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set listA = [5,10,15]
set listB = [2,3,4]
put listA - listB
-- [3, 7, 11]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>In this example, when we subtract listB from list A, the result is a 
      new list where the first item is the difference between the first item of 
      listA and the first item of listB. This is a very handy capability. 
      <P>Now, assume that we have two vertexLists, each with the same number of 
      points (that's very important). If we subtract one list from the other, 
      we'll get a list of points which represents the difference between each 
      corresponding point in the two lists. That list is precisely the amount 
      and direction we would have to move each vertex in order to change the 
      first shape to the second one. 
      <P>Now, since we want to make that change over a number of frames, we need 
      to figure out the incremental change for each vertex <B>per</B> frame. So, 
      if we take the list representing the <B>whole</B> change and divide it by 
      the number of frames in our morph animation, we'll get a list of the 
      incremental change (per frame) for each vertex. 
      <P>

      format 
      <P>So that's the concept. Now let's get to the Lingo. We'll start with the 
      getPropertyDescriptionList handler. This will let the author specify 
      values for the initial shape, the target shape, and the number of frames. 
      Note that the vector member on stage should be a different cast member 
      from either the start or end shape of your morph. That's important because 
      the morph will permanently alter your morphing vector cast member (not 
      just the sprite instance.) So, unless you want to recreate your initial 
      shape again and again, make a copy of it and specify that copy as your 
      starting shape. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- VectorMorph Behavior

end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>In the beginSprite handler, we set some of the properties which weren't 
      specified in the getPropertyDescriptionList handler. pForme1 and pForme2 
      are the vertexLists for the initial and target shapes, respectively. I 
      multiply them by 1.0000 so that we can take full advantage of the fact 
      that vertexLists can be float values. That's important so that we don't 
      get rounding errors when calculating the incremental change. The real key 
      to this whole behavior is that property called pPasMorphing. (It's one of 
      the French variables that Sebastiano named.) 
      <P>This property holds the list of points which are the incremental change 
      per frame. The calculation is condensed to a single line, but it's the 
      same as I described earlier: the difference in the two vertex lists, 
      divided by the number of frames in the animation. The last steps in the 
      beginSprite handler are to initialize our pFlag to #stop, and the 
      pFrameCount to 0. 
      <P>The mouseUp handler simply turns the morphing animation on by setting 
      our pFlag to #morph. That means that on the next enterFrame event, the 
      enterFrame handler will see that pFlag = #morph, and the morphing will 
      begin. The enterFrame handler counts the number of frames in our 
      animation. Each frame, it calls for the shape to be morphed by calling the 
      hMorphAllee handler. This handler simply adds the incremental list 
      (pPasMorphing) to pForme1, and then sets our on-stage shape member to that 
      vertex list. The enterFrame handler counts frames until it reaches the 
      last frame of the animation. 
      <P>For the last frame, rather than having it morph the last time, it 
      simply sets the shape to the target vertex list (pForme2). Finally, it 
      sets our pFlag = #stop so that the morphing animation stops. 
      <P>The last little handler there is simply there for the reset button. It 
      resets our on-stage shape to the vertexList of our initial vector shape 
      member. It also resets the frame count to zero. 
      <P>A final warning. Since we're doing simple subtraction of one vertexList 
      from the other, it is critical that each shape have the same number of 
      vertexes. Further, each vertex point can have points for one or two 
      "handles" which allow the shape to be curved. You must have exactly the 
      same number of handles for corresponding points in the two shapes -- even 
      if those handles are dragged on top of the vertex point (making their 
      effect disappear.) 
      <P>Great idea Sebastiano. Thanks for sending in your code and your 
      question.
