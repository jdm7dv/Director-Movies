      <P>Dear Multimedia Handyman, 
      <P>I am going to program an online game by using Director 7. The problem 
      that I'm facing right now is the database that will store the players' 
      names and scores. I do not know what kind of database to be created. Can 
      you give me an idea what kind of database to be used? If the database has 
      been created, then how to send/add values/ characters that are typed in a 
      field into the database when a button is clicked? 
      <P>How to display the top 10 records from the database? Is it display it 
      in a field too? If so, how to choose from the ten best players(with the 
      highest scores) from the list of records in the database? 
      <P><A href="mailto:jeisum@cnl.com.my">jeisum</A> 
      <P>Dear jeisum, 
      <P>That's a lot of questions, and unfortunately, the answer is... it all 
      depends. It depends on what you want to do and how you want to set it up. 
      It depends on the server technology that you have available to you. And it 
      depends on the game design and how many people will be playing the game at 
      once. So, let's look at some options. 
      <P>The first issue is whether the highscore system is networked, or rather 
      just on the user's machine. We'll examine the networked option first. 
      Let's say that your game is on a website in Malaysia. A guy named "John" 
      in Chicago goes to your page where the Shockwave game downloads to John's 
      computer and he plays your game. Remember that the game is actually 
      running on John's computer, <B>not from your server</B>. Meanwhile, 
      Francois in Paris also goes to your page, downloads and plays your game. 
      At the end of John's game, his score is sent in a message back to your 
      server. Your server sends back a list of the top 10 scores, so the 
      Shockwave game still running on John's computer receives this list and 
      displays the scores. It shows him that his score is the third highest, 
      while Francois in Paris holds the top 2 spots. 
      <P>This is an example where the highscore pits the player against everyone 
      else in the world. Note that in this example, John and Francois are not 
      actually playing the game against each other interactively. Rather, they 
      each play a solitary game on their own computers and the scores are 
      matched at the end. This is "asynchronous", meaning that John and Francois 
      aren't necessarily playing at the same time. (Using the Multiuser Server, 
      you could have many people playing the same networked game at the same 
      time.) 
      <P>To make such a highscore system, you'll need something on the server 
      end to receive a message from the Shockwave game running on the user's 
      computer. So what is that "something"? Typically, that would be referred 
      to as a "cgi script". (CGI stands for "common gateway interface", but I 
      really don't have any insight on what it means.) Think of a cgi as some 
      kind of a processor on the server end. It receives the message from the 
      internet, knows how to process it, perhaps saves the results in a text 
      file or database, then returns a message to the sender. If this seems 
      vague, it's simply because cgi can refer to a lot of different backend 
      processors. For example, a cgi script can be a standalone computer program 
      written in Perl (the most common language for CGI scripts, though there 
      are other possible languages as well.) The webserver would need to be able 
      to run Perl scripts. 
      <P>Another likely alternative would be a database (Filemaker Pro, MS 
      Access, or a generic datafile) which is accessed using Active Server Pages 
      or Cold Fusion or any of the other web application development 
      environments. Since each of these environments has its own protocol for 
      interacting with the data, I can't be very specific about explaining how 
      to send and receive the data. Basically, you'll use Director's postNetText 
      command, calling a specific cgi URL on your server and supplying the 
      score. (That URL is likely to end in .cgi, .asp, .jsp, .cfm, or something 
      that indicates special processing.) It will take the score, insert it into 
      it's appropriate spot in the highscore list and return the 10 top scores. 
      (I strongly recommend you read Zac's article, <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/buildArticle.cfm?id=317">Integrating 
      with Cold Fusion</A>. Even if you don't use Cold Fusion, the concepts are 
      the same.) 
      <P>Another possible "cgi backend" is a Director projector, using the 
      multiuser server or multiuser xtra. This option will require the users to 
      download the multiuser xtra, but that can be coded into the movie so that 
      it happens automatically. If you go with the option, the Director 
      projector will run on your server all the time. Everytime a user loads up 
      your game, it will open a connection to the projector. The projector will 
      keep track of the scores and take care of all the incoming and outgoing 
      messages. If you choose this option, you'll need to master the multiuser 
      server/xtra. We'll be featuring some articles on that in the near future. 
      In the meantime, check Macromedia's site for documentation. 
      <P>Whatever cgi backend you choose, you'll need to decide what you're 
      really going to do with the data. Specifically, how many scores do you 
      really want to store? If the Shockwave game only displays the top 10, is 
      there any reason to save more than that? If not, it will be a very simple 
      database -- storing ten records with fields for score, date and name. On 
      the other hand, you might want to store data on all the games ever 
      completed. In this case, the database would be much larger, and only a 
      select portion of the data would be reported back the the user. 
      <P>This whole approach is fairly elaborate and will require a significant 
      learning curve. Let's examine another option which may suit your needs: a 
      highscore system which is restricted to the user's machine. There is a 
      developer named Bongwook Lee who has created some <A 
      href="http://www.bongwook.com/portfolio.php3" target=_blank>wonderful 
      Shockwave games</A>. He provides a fairly simple highscore approach which 
      I have found quite satisfying as I've grown addicted to his <A 
      href="http://www.bongwook.com/pt/sw/simulis/" target=_blank>Simulus</A> 
      game. The simple approach is that the highscores are the scores of users 
      on a single computer. So as I play game after game, I'm competing against 
      myself -- and my wife who also plays the game on my computer. Let's create 
      this type of system. 
      <P>Here's a demo where you can experiment with the features we'll be 
      including. 
      <P>
      
      <P>A sample movie is available for download in <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/handy110.hqx">Mac</A> or 
      <A href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/handy110.zip">PC</A> 
      format. This is a D7 movie. 
      <P>Lists will adequately store the data we need to keep, and my first 
      inclination was to go for a property list. But the design of this list is 
      a little bit complicated. Let's think about what we want the list to be 
      able to do. For any particular score, we'll want to store the points, the 
      user's name, and the date. We'll need to be able to order the scores (with 
      names and dates) from highest points to lowest points. So if we had a 
      property list that was indexed by the points, we could just sort that 
      list. The problem is that it's possible that you'll have more than one 
      game with the same point total -- both of which need to be listed. As 
      well, it's likely that the same person will play more than one game, and 
      perhaps on the same date. In a property list, you can't have duplicate 
      properties, so we can't index the property list by the values for points, 
      names, or dates. 
      <P>In Tab Julius' book "Lingo - An Advanced Guide", he suggests the use of 
      parallel lists. So imagine that we have one list which stores all of the 
      points, another list for the names, and a third list for the dates. So for 
      any given game score, you'll store the point value in one list, the 
      player's name in a second list, and the date in a third list. The trick is 
      that these values are linked together by their position in their 
      respective list. Take a look at these three lists: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>pointList = [90,180,35,75,105,90,150,95,130,125]
nameList = ["Bob", "Carol","Carol", "Bob", "Alice", ¬
  "Bob", "Ted", "Ted", "Ted", "Alice"]
dateList = ["11/17/99", "11/17/99", "11/17/99", ¬
  "11/19/99", "11/18/99", "11/27/99", "11/23/99", ¬
  "11/19/99", "11/15/99", "11/27/99"]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>For example, look at the fifth value in each list. They indicate that 
      Alice played a game on 11/18/99 and scored 105 points. You can see that 
      it's critical to maintain parallel order in the lists. So that means we 
      cannot use the sort function. Doing so would royally screw up the system 
      by breaking the linkage between points, players' names, and the dates. 
      This is of importance when we need to list the scores in order of highest 
      to lowest points. We'll get to that shortly. 
      <P>We'll use setPref to store the lists in the user's prefs file. For ease 
      in handling the three lists, I'm going to combine them into a single 
      property list which I'll store in a global variable called gScores. Then, 
      I'll save a string version of gScores using setPrefs. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>gScores = [:]
addProp gScores, #points, pointList
addProp gScores, #names, nameList
addProp gScores, #dates, dateList
setPref("myScores", string(gScores))</FONT></PRE>
      <P>So now, gScores is a property list containing all three lists, and it 
      looks like this: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>put gScores
-- [#points: [90, 180, 35, 75, 105, 90, 150, 95, 130, 125], ¬
  #names: ["Bob", "Carol", "Carol", "Bob", "Alice", "Bob", ¬
  "Ted", "Ted", "Ted", "Alice"], #dates: ["11/17/99", ¬
  "11/17/99", "11/17/99", "11/19/99", "11/18/99", ¬
  "11/27/99", "11/23/99", "11/19/99", "11/15/99", ¬
  "11/27/99"]]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>When the game initially loads (on startMovie), I'll use getPref to 
      retrieve the value for gScores from the user's prefs file. That file won't 
      exist the very first time the user plays, so you have to allow for that 
      possibility in the script. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on startMovie</B>

  global gScores
  
  scoreString = getPref("myScores")
  if voidP(scoreString) then 
    -- no scores saved yet
    clearScores
  else
    -- convert prefs string to list
    gScores = value(scoreString)
  end if
  
end startMovie

<B>on clearScores</B>

  global gScores
  
  pointList = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
  nameList = ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
  dateList = ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
  gScores = [:]
  addProp gScores, #points, pointList
  addProp gScores, #names, nameList
  addProp gScores, #dates, dateList  
  setPref("myScores", string(gScores))
  
end clearScores</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This initializes the global variable gScores, using the value stored in 
      the prefs file -- if there was already a value there. If the game has 
      never been played on that computer, then there won't be a value in the 
      prefs file (void), so the clearScores handler sets the initial values for 
      zero and writes that to the prefs file. 
      <P>We'll need a behavior to apply to the text sprite so that the values in 
      gScores can be displayed on the stage. I set up a text member, picking the 
      color and font and setting the tabs for the display I want. Then, apply 
      this behavior: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>global gScores

on beginSprite me
	displayScores me
end beginSprite

<B>on displayScores me</B>

  -- separate the 3 lists from gScores
  pointList = gScores.points
  nameList = gScores.names
  dateList = gScores.dates
  
  -- create rankOrder list
  rankOrder = []
  pointListCopy = duplicate(pointList)
  repeat with i = 1 to 10
    topPosition = getPos(pointListCopy, ¬
      max(pointListCopy))
    add rankOrder, topPosition
    pointListCopy[topPosition] = 0
  end repeat
  
  -- build the text string
  displayText = ""
  rank = 0
  
  repeat with whichPos in rankOrder
    rank = rank + 1
    thisPoints = pointList[whichPos]
    thisName = nameList[whichPos]
    thisDate = dateList[whichPos]
    thisLine = TAB &amp; rank &amp; ":" &amp; TAB &amp; thisPoints &amp; ¬
      TAB &amp; thisName &amp; TAB &amp; thisDate 
    displayText = displayText &amp; thisLine &amp; RETURN
  end repeat
  
  sprite(me.spriteNum).member.text = displayText
  
end displayScores</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The displayScores handler is where we have to deal with pulling 
      corresponding values from each of the three lists. I start the handler by 
      separating out the three lists from the whole gScores list. Now I 
      explained earlier that we can't sort the scores list without screwing up 
      our parallel lists. So we need another way to get the order of the lists 
      from highscore to low. Take a look at this example: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>put gScores.points
-- [90, 180, 35, 75, 105, 90, 150, 95, 130, 125]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This is the pointList from gScores. You can see that they aren't in 
      sorted order, but remember that we don't want to change the order because 
      it corresponds to the other lists. So let's create another list called 
      rankOrder. The rankOrder list will tell us the position in the pointList 
      of the highest to lowest scores. So for the example above... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>rankOrder = [2, 7, 9, 10, 5, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You see that the first value in rankOrder is 2 because the highest 
      score in our pointList above is the second value -- which happens to be 
      180 (irrelevant). The next highest score is the 7th value, followed by the 
      9th, 10th, 5th, 8th, 1st, 6th, 4th... and the 3rd value in the pointList 
      is the lowest. Note that since the 1st and 6th scores are the same, it 
      really doesn't matter which of the two goes first. 
      <P>So that's the concept. Setting rankOrder from the pointList is a little 
      tricky, as you can see in the code of the displayScores handler. But once 
      we have the rankOrder list, it's a breeze to parse the corresponding 
      values from our three data lists. By the way, my variable "rank" has to do 
      with the 1 to 10 that appears on the left side of the stage display. Don't 
      confuse it with rankOrder. 
      <P>All that's left is to enter a player's new score into the list. This 
      won't happen every game, only when the currentScore is greater than the 
      lowest of the 10 high scores. When that happens, that lowest score will 
      get replaced by the new score -- along with the player's name and the 
      current date. Note that the new score probably won't be the lowest, so 
      when a new score goes in, the rankOrder will change. 
      <P>Here's the movie script needed to set a score. When you call this 
      handler (when the game is over) you'll need to supply the value for the 
      currentScore. This handler starts by checking to see if the currentScore 
      is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the pointList. If so, the 
      variable "bumpedPos" is set to the position (not value) of the lowest 
      score in the pointsList. Then the new data is inserted into each of the 
      three lists using the bumpedPos variable to keep them linked to each 
      other. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on setScore currentScore</B>

  global gScores
  
  pointList = gScores.points
  lowestHighScore = min(pointList)
  
  if currentScore &gt;= lowestHighScore then
    bumpedPos = getPos(pointList, min(pointList))
    gScores.points[bumpedPos] = currentScore
    gScores.names[bumpedPos] = member("name").text
    gScores.dates[bumpedPos] = the short date
    setPref("myScores", string(gScores))
  end if
  
end setScore</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Now that you know how it all works, play with the demo movie above. 
      Enter a score which is lower than the lowest value there. Notice that the 
      value is not added to the list. Add a score that is equal to one of the 
      other values. If it's the lowest value, then the newer score replaces the 
      older one. 
      <P>This system is not the answer for a networked online game, but it's a 
      pretty good solution for individual competition or a kiosk game situation. 
      Good luck with your program! </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
