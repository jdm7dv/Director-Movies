<P><B>Invadir 21 - What's Next?</B></P>
<P>This message was sent out to all those who gave feedback on the tutorial up 
to the moment I completed lesson 20:</P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>Greetings everybody.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>You will, I trust, be pleased to hear that the invadirs 
tutorial has been thoroughly updated with some additional material added, 
bringing the project to a more satisfactory conclusion.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>My sincere apologies for the long period of time between 
this and the last update, you will appreciate that this is a labour of love and 
as such can not be prioritised over breadwinning activities where they are 
pressing.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>I am more concerned to reveal that there were some errors 
and problems in the lessons from 15 onwards, which is where many people seemed 
to get stuck. I have now examined the tutorial extremely closely, building a 
movie for each lesson, and I have uploaded director files for the problematic 
lesson 15, so that you can check the code in a working movie.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>As far as I can ascertain, all the code samples now work 
properly. It could still be that there are a few things I overlooked. Please let 
me know if you find anything amiss.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>I am very grateful for the response I have received so far. 
Many of you have made some useful criticisms and indicated some errors. Thank 
you.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>I have tried to respond personally to everybody, if I have 
missed anybody, I'm sorry about that. If anybody has ended up on my "mailing 
list" in error, I apologise. Please let me know so that I can remove 
you.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>There will, I suppose, be more work on the tutorial later, 
but I feel that I have now left it in a state where it stands by itself. Please 
do check James Newton's interesting extension of the material. I'd like, at some 
point, to make explicit reference to his article in the tutorial. <A 
href="http://perso.planetb.fr/newton/">His website</A> also contains many 
interesting experiments and inspiring examples which could help you with other 
games. A sensible "next step".</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>There are some new directions I could take with the 
tutorial at this point. The one I am most hooked on is to wrap the whole thing 
in a MIAW so that it can run inside Director. I'd also like to update it for D7, 
at least in the long term.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>Additions I'd like to have made but haven't (yet) 
are</FONT></TT></P>
<P><B><TT><FONT size=-1>Keyboard control</FONT></TT></B><TT><FONT size=-1> 
<BR>Complications with Director 6 mean that this is not beginners stuff, 
Director7 uses proper key polling so it is less of a problem.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><B><TT><FONT size=-1>Cast member animation</FONT></TT></B><TT><FONT 
size=-1><BR>I have hinted at this in a recently added lesson, but it is an 
obvious part of the whole game building process that, for example, things 
explode when they get hit. I have some techniques to make this quite easy and 
flexible.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><B><TT><FONT size=-1>High Score Table</FONT></TT></B><TT><FONT 
size=-1><BR>This is, according to many clients anyway, what people play the game 
for. I find this a little strange; I've never been very competitive by nature, 
so getting a high score to me is of secondary importance to how much of a crack 
I have playing the game. A full exploration of this topic would also include 
writing external files with fileIO, setPrefs and elementary cgi 
scripting.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><B><TT><FONT size=-1>Splash Screens</FONT></TT></B><TT><FONT 
size=-1><BR>Surprisingly, you can spend as much time, or more, wrapping the game 
up with those screens which appear while you're not actually playing. For a real 
arcade console, this is the part that makes you insert your coin, so to the suit 
guys it's very important! This is a question of packaging. Taste, aesthetics and 
semiotics enter the picture: Lots of grey areas to argue about.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>These may or may not be added in the near 
future.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>I hope you have found the tutorial stimulating, that you 
have learned something useful from it. I'm especially happy to have heard from 
beginners who found it a powerful head start; from jaded score users who always 
had trouble getting into lingo; and from teachers who already are using the 
material in the classroom. These were exactly the audiences I wanted to 
reach.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>Clearly, the game never gets to be a commercially viable 
product without some extra effort. This is all well and good. My best wishes go 
out to anybody who would like to try and make a commercial product based on the 
invadirs. I would appreciate a credit, but that's up to you.</FONT></TT></P>
<P><TT><FONT size=-1>Many thanks for your patience and feedback. I look forward 
to a richer surfing and multimedia experience when you guys sow your shockwave 
seeds.<BR>-- <BR>_____________</FONT></TT></P>
