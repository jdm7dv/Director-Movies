<P><B>Lesson 7 - Messages between Objects</B></P>
<P>Great going so far, although we really want the<TT> shoot </TT>message to 
come from somewhere other than the message window. Remember the message window 
will not be there in the finished product. We also need something easy for the 
user so that they can shoot quickly. We could use the mouse button, but I'd 
rather not because if you click outside Director accidentally the movie will 
stop running and you'll bring some other application to the front. This is 
irritating (believe me) so it might be better to use the keyboard.</P>
<P>We could get the bullet to check the keyboard when it is not shooting but it 
might be conceptually better for the cannon to do this and for the<TT> shoot 
</TT>message to come from the cannon. We also want the invader to be able to 
shoot bullets. We can now apply what we now know about properties and the 
beginsprite message to the cannon script:</P><PRE>property mySprite, bullet

on beginsprite me

  set mySprite to the spritenum of me
  set bullet to 2

end

on exitFrame me

  set stagewidth to the width of the rect of the stage

  if the mouseH &gt; 0 and the mouseH &lt; stagewidth then

    set the locH of sprite mySprite to the mouseH

  end if

  if the shiftDown then

    shoot sprite bullet

  end if

end</PRE>
<P>When you run the movie you will find that pressing the shift key on the 
keyboard launches a bullet from the cannon. When the bullet disappears from the 
screen it is ready to be shot again. Notice that it is the cannon which monitors 
the state of the shift key (use of non 'modifier' keys is more complicated) and 
sends a message to the sprite specified by its<TT> bullet </TT>property. Now we 
have to turn out attention to collisions between the bullet and its targets so 
that the invaders can be hit by the bullet.</P>
<P>Director provides several convenient features for collisions and 
intersections. We are going to use the easiest and most accurate. Let's look 
again at the exitframe handler of the bullet script.</P><PRE>on exitFrame me

  if shooting then

    set myV to the locV of sprite mySprite

    if myV &lt; 0 then

      set shooting to false
      set the locV of sprite mysprite to -999
      return

    end if

    set the locV of sprite mySprite to myV - 1

  end if

end</PRE>
<P>After the first test (<TT>shooting</TT>) has proved true, we therefore know 
that the bullet is moving. It is at this moment that we test whether the bullet 
has moved offstage, and it is therefore at this moment that we test for 
collisions. For now we'll test for collisions with only the first of our 
invaders, the one in channel 3.</P><PRE>on exitFrame me

  if shooting then

    set myV to the locV of sprite mySprite

    if myV &lt; 0 then

      set shooting to false
      set the locV of sprite mysprite to -999
      return

    end if


    if sprite mysprite intersects 3 then

      hit sprite 3

    end if

    set the locV of sprite mySprite to myV - 1

  end if

end</PRE>
<P>Once again, we are using a custom message,<TT> hit </TT>, addressed to sprite 
3, but if we run the movie now, a collision between the bullet and the invader 
in sprite channel 3 will produce an error, 'handler not defined'. This is 
because the script attached to sprite 3 has no way of handling the message. </P>
<P>There are ways of avoiding the error without adding an extra handler to the 
invader script, but in this case the error message indicates our next step. We 
need to get the invader to respond to the<TT> hit </TT>message by adding the 
necessary handler. Here is how the invader script will look just after we have 
added the skeleton for the new<TT> hit </TT>handler:</P><PRE>property mySprite, hdirection, stagewidth

on beginsprite me

  set mySprite to the spritenum of me
  set hdirection to 1
  set stagewidth to the width of the rect of the stage

end

on exitFrame me

  set myH to the locH of sprite mySprite

  if myH &lt; 0 then

    set hdirection to 1

  end if

  if myH &gt; stagewidth then

    set hdirection to -1

  end if

  set the locH of sprite mySprite to myH + hdirection

end

on hit me

   
end</PRE>
<P>...and if all we wanted was to avoid the 'handler not defined' error, this 
would do just fine, only we want the invader to stop doing what it was doing and 
die. This requires something similar to the state variable<TT> shooting </TT>in 
the bullet script. We could add a property called<TT> alive </TT>so that the 
invader only moved from side to side if<TT> alive </TT>were true. This is how 
the script would look if we did this.</P><PRE>property mySprite, hdirection, stagewidth, alive

on beginsprite me

  set mySprite to the spritenum of me
  set hdirection to 1
  set stagewidth to the width of the rect of the stage
  set alive to true

end

on exitFrame me

  if not alive then 

    return 

  end if 

  set myH to the locH of sprite mySprite 

  if myH &lt; 0 then 

    set hdirection to 1 

  end if 

  if myH &gt; stagewidth then 
    set hdirection to -1 
  end if 

  set the locH of sprite mySprite to myH + hdirection 
end 

on hit me 
  set alive to false 
  set the locH of sprite mySprite to -999 
end</PRE>
<P>Later we will modify this so that the invader will run a little animation 
while it is dying. This means that simple alive and not alive will not be 
adequate to describe the different kinds of behevior we want from the 
invader.</P>
<P>Now at last we have some gameplay. Run the movie and try and shoot at sprite 
3. If you are successful, sprite 3 should disappear. This is fine, but what 
about the other invaders?</P>
