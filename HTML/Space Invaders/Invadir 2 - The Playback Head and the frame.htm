<P><B>Lesson 2 - The Playback Head and</B></P><PRE>the frame</PRE>
<P>You'll probably have noticed that when you run a movie in Director, the 
playback head (the vertical red line in the score) moves horizontally to the 
right 'reading' and displaying the sprites in each frame on the stage. This is 
fine for linear animations, although you can get much better results authoring 
linear animation with <A 
href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/aftereffects/main.html">Adobe After 
Effects</A> or <A href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/">Macromedia 
Flash</A>. If you want to do something more flexible and interactive you are 
probably going to need to create a stable state where the playback head is not 
rushing off somewhere else all the time.</P>
<P>The first Lingo anyone should ever learn, therefore, is that which tells the 
playback head to loop continuously in the same frame. you can use a looping 
playback head to drive the interactivity like a motor.</P>
<P>There are <A 
href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/director/ts/documents/simple_timebased_delay.htm">other 
techniques</A> that some people find useful which involve stopping the playback 
head altogether and creating your own tight loop, but this has now been 
officially discouraged by Macromedia so I'm not going to cover those here. Tight 
loops also have a tendency to dominate all the processor time. Too bad if you 
happen to be downloading a file in the background. Here's how to make a simple 
frame loop then:</P>
<P>Have a look in the score. On the left you will see a column of numbers, each 
referring to a sprite channel, the 'layers' of the visual part of your movie. At 
the top of them, above a little popup menu is another channel with a little icon 
of a script instead of a number. This is the <B>framescript</B> channel and it 
is where you will put scripts which will apply to particular frames. 
Double-click in the framescript channel in the score window and fill in the 
script as follows...</P><PRE>on exitFrame
  go to the frame
end</PRE>
<P>When you do this, you will create and attach a new score script (or behavior) 
cast member. The script cast member is therefore attached to the frame where you 
double-clicked. You can attach the same script to other frames by dragging the 
cast member into the framescript channel and you can delete the attachment by 
selecting it in the score and using the normal keyboard backspace / delete 
key.</P>
<P>If you delete an attached script from the score, the script cast member 
remains in the cast. Watch out, because if you delete the cast member, the 
framescript channel keeps a reference to the slot in the cast where the cast 
member <B>used to be</B>, which might cause complications later.</P>
<P>Whenever the playback head leaves a frame, Director takes care that an</P><PRE>exitframe</PRE>
<P>message is sent to all scripts attached in that frame.</P><PRE>on exitframe</PRE>
<P>means "when the<TT> exitframe </TT>message is received here, do the following 
things..."</P>
<P><TT>go </TT>is a lingo instruction to the playback head to go to a particular 
frame. The<TT> to </TT>is optional, but it is essential that you specify 
<B>which</B> frame you want the playback head to go to.</P>
<P><TT>the frame</TT> stands in for a whole number, which is always the current 
frame number. This is always exactly the same as the number you can see 
displayed in the control panel.</P>
<P><TT>end</TT> means "I've finished describing what should happen when the 
message is received here".</P>
<P>You have just completed a <B>handler</B>. All handlers have the following 
skeletal structure:</P><PRE>on <B><FONT color=#ff0000>message</FONT></B>
  <B><FONT color=#ff0000>instructions</FONT></B>
end</PRE>
<P>...and there can be any number of instructions, though each one must occupy a 
line to itself. This script therefore instructs the playback head to go back to 
the same frame it is just leaving. This is perhaps the most fundamental Lingo 
script of all, so you really ought to get to know it by heart. It is rare to 
make a Director presentation which does not include a script like this.</P>
<P>Incidentally, because we want to loop in frame 1, we could just as well have 
written...</P><PRE>on exitFrame
  go to 1
end</PRE>
<P>...but then we would be obliged to keep this script and all the action in 
frame 1. If we later decided to make an animated introduction for the game in 
frames 1-20, we would have to modify and move the script. If we wanted to have 
loops in several different frames, we would be obliged to make several versions 
of the same script. By using</P><PRE>the frame</PRE>
<P>...it doesn't matter which frame we use, and we can reuse the same 
script.</P>
<P>This illustrates a general principle which will come up again and again. 
Basically it's smart to write your scripts once, and then refine them for reuse 
instead of writing hundreds of new and unique scripts which do essentially the 
same job. There are several very good reasons for this and I will return to the 
principle and highlight those reasons later in this tutorial.</P><PRE>the frame</PRE>
<P>is a lingo <B>property</B>, a term which will be described later. All you 
need to know for now is it refers to the particular frame the playback head is 
at. If you open the Director control panel, you will see</P><PRE>the frame</PRE>
<P>displayed there. Notice the way it changes as you click in different frames 
in the score.</P>
<P>If you run your movie you will notice that the playback head seems to stop 
where the script is. Try dragging the attached script to another frame, rewind 
and play the movie. Notice the way the playback head plays normally until it 
reaches the script. When you're happy with that, drag it back to frame 1.</P>
<P>Actually, the playback head does not stop at all, although it might seem like 
it. It keeps moving, but because it stays in the same frame it looks stationary. 
Those</P><PRE>exitframe</PRE>
<P>messages that are keeping it in one place are going to be very useful...</P>
