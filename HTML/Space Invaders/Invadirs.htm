<P>This tutorial is designed to introduce the core concepts of <A 
href="http://brennan.young.net/Edu/OOThink.html">Object Oriented Lingo</A> 
through the gradual development of a simple "Space Invaders" type game. It is 
ideal for eager beginners and intermediate users who have a basic understanding 
of the score, the stage and the cast.</P>
<P>I also expect users of this tutorial to be familiar with modern computer 
interfaces such as the MacOS or Windows 95. You should understand how to use a 
mouse, how to double click, how to drag and drop, copy, cut and paste, how 
windows, menus and scrollbars work etc.</P>
<P>Finally, it is important that users of this tutorial are familiar with a 
version of a 'Space Invaders' game. Anyone who does not know this ubiquitous 
game in one of its many forms must have been living in a hole for the last 
twenty years and probably needs to learn some other stuff before getting into 
multimedia design. For a recap of the original arcade space monsters, you might 
want to try <A

<P><B><BR>Pedagogical information. Educators take note.</B></P>
<P>I have been using 'Invadirs' as a teaching example with absolute beginners at 
Danmarks Designskole in Copenhagen with considerable success. It is very common 
to teach Director starting with linear animation and buttons, gradually 
introducing Lingo and leaving object-oriented programming to the very end. 
Unfortunately most courses are too short to get on to the OO stuff, and the 
other stuff throws up so many distractions and complications (mostly to do with 
making the paradigm shift away from the movie metaphor) that by the very end, 
everybody is sick, jaded and confused.</P>
<P>I have found that students who were exposed to the OO material early on 
gained a far greater understanding of Director, and produced higher quality work 
much more rapidly than when I followed the more conventional multimedia teaching 
approach.</P>
<P>I used to believe that it was important that every student have a computer to 
herself. Although I still believe that there are problems when there are too 
many people fighting over the mouse, I have discovered that when there are two 
or three at the same machine, there is a greater willingness to exchange 
suggestions and try stuff out without the same fear of failure that arises in a 
student working alone. If it goes wrong, it's easier to share the blame or just 
laugh, if it works out, miniature celebrations and whoops of pleasure can be 
enjoyed by everyone involved.</P>
<P>If you would like to use this material in a teaching environment, please feel 
free to do so. You may print out and duplicate the text and distribute it for 
educational puposes in a public institution. I only ask you to <A 
href="mailto:brennan@young.net">email me</A> with some feedback about how it 
went, perhaps some links to finished student work based on this material and so 
on. I'd also be very interested in any other suggestions you might have about 
the pedagogical aspects.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>How this Tutorial Came About, What it's REALLY for and all that.</B></P>
<P>I'm constantly surprised that the quality of educational material for 
Director is so poor. There have been a couple of good books, Peter Small's '<A 
href="http://www.avatarnets.com/Overview/lingsorc.htm">Lingo Sorcery</A>' was 
unique for a long time in covering the most important issues, although it also 
dips frequently into esoterica. Right now <A 
href="http://www.zeusprod.com/nutshell/">Bruce Epstein's</A> 'Lingo In a 
Nutshell' and 'Director In a Nutshell' stand head and shoulders above the rest. 
Other recommended writers are <A 
href="http://clevermedia.com/rosenz/index.html">Gary Rosenzweig</A> and Tab 
Julius. Most books out there are truly dreadful. The only 'official' <A 
href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</A> book I would recommend is the 
Lingo Dictionary, which comes when you buy the software (kind of expensive).</P>
<P>Don't forget that there is always a risk that 'authorized' books are just 
thinly disguised marketing material. In the case of one official Macromedia 
'Lingo' book which covers XRes in absurd detail (another Macromedia product used 
by almost nobody), this is quite blatant. The other thing is that the official 
books will never tell you all the gotchas, smart little tips and tricks and 
workarounds for bugs. In the official mindset there are <B>no</B> bugs or 
shortcomings so there is no point mentioning them. If you want to pay extra for 
companies to promote their products, go ahead, just don't expect to learn much. 
To be fair to Macromedia, this goes for all software companies, some are better, 
some worse.</P>
<P>It therefore took some courage for me to start teaching the way I actually 
use Director in the classroom, feeling a bit crazy because no-one else seemed to 
do it that way. Ironically it was a decision at the school to make the courses 
harder and encourage dropouts (too many students, not enough resources) that 
made me go for space invaders seriously as a teaching example.</P>
<P>It had the opposite effect. Not only did I have zero dropouts, two 
'stowaways' sat in on the course until the very end! The work produced was 
dynamic, witty and unique. No one produced a slide show. Instead of everybody 
solving different problems in the same way, the students found themselves 
dealing with the same problems in different ways. This was a victory for 
creativity.</P>
<P>With such success I became curious about whether the material would work on 
the web, or as text, hence this site.</P>
<P>My master plan is to get a more people into using Director in a similar way 
to me so that they will be able to hassle Macromedia into improving the tool to 
suit my own needs! Naturally I believe my approach is the right one, so I want 
to see it served better by the tool. It's no good people <A 
href="http://brennan.young.net/Comp/Dwishes.html">sending wishlists to 
Macromedia</A> if they still swallow the movie metaphor uncritically.</P>
<P>I have already made suggestions about improvements at odd places during the 
lessons. Towards the end of the tutorial I will expose some of the more serious 
weaknesses of Director and expressly encourage readers to make informed wishes 
for these things to be improved in future versions. This way we will all get a 
better product.</P>
<P>Some people have asked me whether I will make tutorials for other games, or 
whether I have any plans to make a book about Shockwave games. This was not my 
original intention, although I can see now that there is a need for such a book 
especially now that Macromedia is focussing on this kind of content.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that I will make similar tutorials for other games, I hope 
that the techniques described for space invaders can be applied to other kinds 
of interactivity. This is why I chose space invaders as my first proper 
object-oriented Director project when I was teaching myself Lingo with Director 
5.</P>
<P>If there is continued interest in a book on Shockwave games I will strongly 
consider it. Please <A href="mailto:brennan@young.net">email me</A> with any 
comments about this or any other suggestions and questions you may have.</P>
<P>...AND BEFORE YOU SEND ME ANY ATTACHMENTS... <BR>I'd rather you didn't. I can 
usually advise on stubborn errors if you describe your observations, which 
lesson you are on and so on. Enough people have sent me large files asking 
"Please check my code" for me to request now that you ASK before sending 
unsolicted attachments. If you send me large files without asking, you can 
expect a disgruntled reply at best.</P>
<P>All email contact will result in you being personally informed of any 
enhancements/revisions of the content presented here. I promise I will not sell 
your email address to unscrupulous capitalist spam scum.</P>
