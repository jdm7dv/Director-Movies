<P><B>Lesson 1 - Getting Started</B></P>
<P>You are going to need a copy of Director 6 or later.</P>
<P>With Director running, select <B>New Movie</B> from the <B>File</B> menu so 
that you are starting afresh.</P>
<P>Select <B>Movie... Properties</B> from the <B>Modify</B> Menu and click on 
the stagecolor chip. Select a "night sky" colour like Dark Blue or Black.</P>
<P>You will also need some media. If you want to make them in Director, that's 
fine, you can also make it in a number of other graphic applications. 
Alternatively you could simply copy and paste the graphics from this page into 
the Cast of your movie.</P>
<P>The media you require most immediately will be:</P>
<P>
<TABLE border=1 cellPadding=1 cellSpacing=1 height=128 width="100%">
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD height=53 width="50%"><B>Two graphics of a space invader facing left 
      and right respectively.</B></TD>
    <TD align=middle bgColor=#000000 width="50%"><IMG align=bottom border=0 
      height=41 src="Invadir 1 - Getting Started_files/inv1.gif" width=62> <IMG 
      align=bottom alt=inv2 height=41 
      src="Invadir 1 - Getting Started_files/inv2.gif" width=62></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD height=29 width="50%"><B>A bullet graphic</B></TD>
    <TD align=middle bgColor=#000000 width="50%"><IMG align=bottom alt=bullet 
      height=5 src="Invadir 1 - Getting Started_files/Bullet.gif" width=7></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD height=35 width="50%"><B>A graphic for the player's defensive 
      cannon.</B></TD>
    <TD align=middle bgColor=#000000 width="50%"><IMG align=bottom border=0 
      height=23 src="Invadir 1 - Getting Started_files/Cannon.gif" 
  width=45></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>When you've done this, your cast window should look something like this:</P>
<P align=center><IMG align=bottom alt=castshot border=1 height=145 
src="Invadir 1 - Getting Started_files/castshot.gif" width=272></P>
<P>As you can see I have named each graphic appropriately. It's very good 
practice to name your cast members because you can refer to them by their names 
in you Lingo code. There are also a number of tricks that can be performed with 
Lingo to select cast members for display or use, purely according to their 
names. For this reason it is quite important that your cast members have unique 
names. Give your cast members the same names as shown here ("inv1", "inv2", 
"cannon" and "bullet"). Now <B>Save</B> the movie as</P><PRE>"Inva.DIR"</PRE>
<P>The cast is where all the media you use in your movie is stored. It's 
possible to use media which is not in the cast, and it's possible to have media 
in the cast which are not used at all. I'm not going to dwell on those issues 
here. The reader is referred again to <A 
href="http://www.zeusprod.com/nutshell/">Brue Epstein's</A> Director in a 
Nutshell. You can download a free chapter covering this stuff from his 
website.</P>
<P>Cast members are basically stored media. When you save your movie, the 
contents of any internal casts are stored too.</P>
<P>Cast members only become useful when they are on the stage (as sprites) or 
otherwise activated by scripts or effects channels (in the case of sounds, 
transitions, palettes etc.). You can also have the same cast member appearing 
many times on the screen and in different frames of your movie, which provides a 
tremendous bandwidth advantage over uncompressed digital video (for example) 
where every pixel of every frame usually has to be stored as seperate data.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it is not uncommon for a cast to contain thousands of cast 
members. It might seem unlikely now, but you really should get into the habit of 
naming and organising your cast members so that when your projects grow they do 
not become unmanageable.</P>
