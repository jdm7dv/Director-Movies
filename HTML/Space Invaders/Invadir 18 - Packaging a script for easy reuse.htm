<P><B>Invadir 18 - Packaging a script for easy reuse</B></P>
<P>One of the most often-mentioned advantages of object-oriented design is that 
classes are <B>reuseable</B>. If you design a button behavior which is general 
enough for all the buttons in one project, the chances are good that you can use 
the same button class in several other projects. You may even have used a 
premade behavior for a button. If you were really brave, you might even have had 
a look at the script and been shocked at the complexity of something as 
seemingly innocuous as a button. Writing scripts for buttons is a drag. You can 
be glad that there are several publically available behaviors to do this 
essential task. On the other hand, you REALLY learn about logic when you have to 
consider all the possible permutations that a button can have in relation to the 
mouse, especially in combination with other user interface controls.</P>
<P>A more sober and honest view is that many / most programmers do <B>not</B> 
automatically consider reuse when they make their object designs, especially if 
it 'seems likely' that the object is a one-off. It is possible to make 
completely non-reuseable objects just as it possible to use a non OO programming 
language to make something completely reuseable. Nevertheless, there are other 
advantages to an OO approach, not least because the amount of complexity in any 
system can be reduced to manageable proportions by the magic of 
encapsulation.</P>
<P>Let's assume we <B>do</B> want a script to be reuseable, though. Reuseablity 
is an important advantage afforded by <B>careful</B> OO design. You can save 
yourself literally days of work by having a reliable library of behaviors. Sure, 
you are likely to need to make modifications as special cases arise, but you 
should always look upon these as opportunities to make the classes even more 
general, rather than hacking a quick hard-coded fix into your carefully 
constructed code. Even if you think that you are making something completely 
unique, this is almost always a delusion. You'll end up kicking yourself for not 
considering reuse when the midnight oil starts burning and you're trying to 
disentangle classes from a previous project which are behaving like a day-old 
plate of spaghetti.</P>
<P>I can't imagine that making a completely reuseable 'invader' object is going 
to be a very smart idea, you can only make space invaders so many times before 
the market gets saturated. After this tutorial goes out, 'space invader' 
shockwaves are going to be two a penny! The fact that we've got this far 
illustrates the fact that OO has other advantages over reuseability.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we just made a script which could be useful in any number 
of different projects, the <B>temporary loop</B> script which was added in the 
previous lesson. This has the added advantage (for illustrational purposes) of 
being small and relatively unrelated to the complexity which is emerging in 
other scripts. The other scripts are already too complicated for my liking. If 
they were split into two or three seperate parts, each part responsible for a 
subset of the activities those scripts are currently responsible for, maybe they 
too could become reuseable...</P>
<P>So. Consider a reuseable temporary loop script. It's no good hardcoding the 
destination into the script like this. This would mean we would need to make a 
different script for each destination, and maybe even for each delay value (max) 
too. What we <B>really</B> want is to be able to configure the destination 
independently of the script itself. Then we can use the script to loop for a 
while in any frame we like and then jump to any frame we like.</P>
<P>Lingo provides a superb way for us to do exactly this, a special handler 
which must be constructed to return a kind of list which describes the 
properties which are to be configured from the outside. It is the closest Lingo 
comes to an 'interface' description, or declaration of publicly available 
structure. I mentioned it earlier, and in this case it would look like this:</P><PRE><FONT size=-1>--temporary loop script</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>property destination, max, counter</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>on beginsprite me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>   set max to 50</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   set counter to 0</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>end</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>on exitframe me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>   if counter &lt; max then
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      set counter to counter + 1</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      go to the frame
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   else
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      go to destination
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   end if</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>end</FONT>
<B></B>
<FONT size=-1>on getPropertyDescriptionList me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>   <B>return [#destination:[#comment:"Destination frame", #format:#marker, #default: the framelabel]]</B></FONT>
<B></B>
<FONT size=-1>end</FONT></PRE>
<P>If you see a dialog box appearing when you click the recompile button telling 
you that some properties have changed, just click on "Keep Current".</P>
<P>Now this script is in the framescript channel of frame 3. Open the behavior 
inspector, click on the the framescript channel of frame 3, then click on the 
blue diamond button at the top of the behavior inspector. <BR><IMG align=bottom 
alt="parameters button" height=22 
src="Invadir 18 - Packaging a script for easy reuse_files/params.gif" 
width=24></P>
<P>When you do this, a dialog box will appear asking you to choose a destination 
frame from a popup list. Notice that the framelabels you added to the score 
appear here. This is described by the format, being of type<TT> 
#marker</TT>.</P>
<P>You may well have seen a dialog box like like this if you have used any of 
the behaviors supplied with Director, or downloaded some from the internet, but 
it's still magic when you make it happen yourself. Try and see the relationship 
between the handler and the dialog box.</P>
<P>getPropertyDescriptionList is a <B>function</B>, meaning it is a handler 
which <B>returns a value</B>. A getPropertyDescriptionList handler should always 
return a list, and it should always be a <B>property list</B>. Remember that a 
property list is a list where each item in that list has a 'label' (or 
<B>property</B>), usually designated by a symbol value.</P>
<P>If you change your mind about the settings of a behavior, you can open the 
behavior inspector, click on the sprite or framescript with the behavior and 
then click on the blue diamond button at the top of the behavior inspector. This 
will open the property dialog box again.</P>
<P>Notice that the assignment statement which previously set the destination in 
the beginsprite handler is now gone. It is no longer needed because the value is 
set by the property dialog box.</P>
<P>For the sake of demonstration (and reuseability), lets extend this a bit 
further:</P><PRE><FONT size=-1>--temporary loop script</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>property destination, max, counter</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>on beginsprite me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>   set counter to 0</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>end</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>on exitframe me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>   if counter &lt; max then
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      set counter to counter + 1
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      go to the frame
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   else
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>      go to destination
</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   end if</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>end</FONT>
<B></B>
<FONT size=-1>on getPropertyDescriptionList me</FONT>
<B></B>
<FONT size=-1>   set pdlist to [:]</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   addProp pdlist, #destination, [#comment:"Destination frame", #format:#marker, #default: the framelabel]</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   addProp pdlist, #max, [#comment:"Delay for how many frames?", #format:#integer, #default:30, #range:[#min:0,#max:999]]</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>   return pdlist</FONT>
<B></B>
<FONT size=-1>end</FONT></PRE>
<P>Now you can see that there have been <B>two</B> properties added to the 
dialog box. To make the function a bit tidier and easier to type, I have 
constructed a local variable, pdlist, to store the data structure as it is being 
put together. The<TT> addprop </TT>instruction is a special Lingo instuction 
which adds items to property lists. The list is first constructed empty 
<B>[:]</B> and then filled with the two property lists which describe how the 
property is going to appear in the dialog box. The property <TT>#range</TT>, 
when used with data of type <TT>#integer </TT>can be constructed to describe an 
integer slider with yet another property list describing the minimum and maximum 
values. Try it and see!</P>
<P>The <TT>#range </TT>property is optional. <TT>#comment</TT>, <TT>#format</TT> 
and <TT>#default</TT> are mandatory. An error will occur if you leave one of 
them out.</P>
<P>There are a couple of other remarkeable things that can be added to the 
getPropertyDescriptionList function. For example, properties which are either 
true or false can be included, the format is<TT> #boolean </TT>and they appear 
as a checkbox. This might bring about a feeling of realisation inside you about 
the relationship between GUIs and the underlying code of any computer system you 
work with. If you want to know more about this excellent feature, it is strongly 
recommended that you look at<TT> getPropertyDescriptionList </TT>in the Lingo 
Dictionary or the online help.</P>
<P>So, you can see now that this behavior could be a very useful part of any 
number of multimedia productions long after your experience with 'Invadirs' has 
passed into fond memory.</P>
<P>Now here is a version of a behavior which I carry around with me in my own 
trusty library of reuseable scripts, and which is an enhancement of the 
above.<BR></P><PRE><FONT size=-1>--Frame Looper--</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>on getBehaviorDescription me</FONT>

<FONT size=-1>  set t to t&amp;"· Frame Looper ·"&amp;return</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>  set t to t&amp;"This will make the playback head loop in the current frame "</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>  set t to t&amp;"until a specified number of frames"
  set t to t&amp;"have passed, then it will jump to the specified frame"
  set t to t&amp;" with an optional transition."&amp;return</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>  return t</FONT>
<FONT size=-1>end</FONT></PRE>
<P>
<HR align=left>

<P></P>
<P>Just a few comments here. This behavior also affords the opportunity of a 
<B>transition</B> as the playback head moves from one frame to another. You may 
have used the transition channel in the score, and I wouldn't be surprised if 
you found it didn't work to your liking.</P>
<P>The<TT> puppettransition </TT>instruction will ensure that when you start to 
play the game again, there will be a screen effect. If you're going to use 
transitions at all, make them fast and use them sparingly because they dominate 
the computer's processor completely. You should certainly not expect there to be 
any interactivity during a transition. It is also much better to use the lingo 
instruction<TT> puppettransition </TT>than to use the transition channel in the 
score because it gives you precise control over when a transition occurs.</P>
<P>It is recommended that you look in the Lingo Dictionary or in the online help 
for complete information about the parameters you can pass to<TT> 
puppettransition </TT>.</P>
<P>You will notice also that the range given in the line describing transtype is 
a linear (not property) list. Supplying a linear list as the range, produces a 
<B>popup list</B> of the values found in the list.</P>
<P>Finally, an extra function has been added,<TT> getBehaviorDescription</TT>, 
which forms the 'human' part of the behaviors' interface. The string (text) 
returned by this function appears in the lower part of the behavior inspector. 
This is where you describe what the behavior does, what messages it understands, 
how to use it and anything else which you think is relevant. It is bad manners 
to distribute a behavior publicly without including this handler, constructed 
properly of course. Etiquette aside, you can not expect people to use your 
wonderful reuseable behavior if they do not know what it does or how to use 
it.</P>
<P><B>Something about strings</B>;</P>
<P>Strings are sequences of keyboard characters (text). They contain <B>no</B> 
font or formatting information (Times Bold etc.) and are denoted with the 
double-quote " character at the beginning and end. An empty string, therefore, 
is described as "". Lingo has a very powerful and complete library of string 
processing functions and properties.</P>
<P>The<TT> &amp; </TT>character 'chains' string values together, a process 
called <B>concatenation</B>.</P>
<P>Note that the keyword<TT> return </TT>is used in two different ways, as an 
instruction to leave the handler with the return value, and as a string constant 
denoting the keyboard carriage return. It is the context which specifies the 
meaning.</P>
<P><B>Encapsulation for Reuse</B></P>
<P>These two handlers are one of Director's strongest features as an authoring 
environent. They make reuse and encapsulation a pleasure. The only drag is 
typing the handlers properly, but don't despair, there are several utilities 
around on the net to facilitate the construction of the 
getPropertyDescriptionList handler. You might try my own, "GPDL Tool", available 
from <A href="http://www.planet.dk/planet_98/common/share/share_main.html">The 
Planet website</A>.</P>
<P>Often you will spend some time at the beginning of the production phase 
creating behaviors, then you can finish off simply configuring them with dialog 
boxes in particular contexts. Better still, you can pass out finished behaviors 
to others who might be working on the same project. Without touching a line of 
your code, they can easily configure the behaviors for the various circumstances 
in the project. It is therefore well worth understanding these handlers, 
especially getPropertyDescriptionList. If you do have any confusion, run over 
this lesson again and check the Lingo dictionary. You might also want to look at 
some <A href="http://www.behaviors.com/lbd/">publicly available behaviors</A> to 
see just how many different kinds of dialog boxes can be configured using this 
basic interface description standard.</P>
