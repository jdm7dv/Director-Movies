      <P>Director 7 added many interesting new features. One of the more useful 
      is the ability to add hyperlinks to Text members. This allows you to 
      quickly add HTML-like capabilities to your projects with a minimum of 
      code. Hyperlinks can be added to a Text member in one of two ways; either 
      using Lingo to manually attach the hyperlinks to words or characters or by 
      setting the Text member's .html property to HTML content that uses 
      standard anchors ( &lt;a href="../someFile.html"&gt; ). Both approaches 
      have their benefits and drawbacks and are, ultimately, suited for very 
      different purposes. 
      <P>A sample movie is available for download in <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/UD95.hqx">Mac</A> or <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/UD95.zip">PC</A> format. 
      This is a Director 7 movie. It might be useful if you downloaded the movie 
      now and used it as a reference while you read the article. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using 
      Lingo</FONT></H4>
      <P>In order for you to be able to display hyperlinks in a Text member the 
      Use Hypertext Styles checkbox in the Member Options dialog needs to be 
      checked. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=402 src="UD95_files/UD95.gif" width=389> 
      <P>Alternately can set this in Lingo by setting the useHypertextStyles 
      property of the member to TRUE. You can still use hyperlinks with this 
      property set to FALSE (or turned off) but you then have to manually check 
      the hyperlink ranges to see if they have been clicked...and the idea here 
      is to make this process as easy as possible to implement and use. 
      <P>Before you actually start to add and use hyperlinks you need a behavior 
      to respond to the hyperlink clicked event and process the information in 
      the hyperlink itself. Happily this is fairly easy to do. 
      <P>Start up Director and then draw a Text member on the stage. Create a 
      new behavior and add the following code: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pMemberRef

on beginsprite me
  pMemberRef = sprite(me.spriteNum).member
end

on hyperLinkClicked me, theHyperlink, range
  put theHyperlink
  put pMemberRef.text.char[range[1]..range[2]]
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This is a <B>very</B> basic hyperlink handler but it illustrates 
      everything you need to know to create more robust code. The event your 
      code needs to trap is the hyperlinkClicked event. The event carries two 
      pieces of information with it. The data in the hyperlink and the range (in 
      characters) of the link that was clicked. The sample behavior simply 
      displays the hyperlink contents in the Message Window along with the 
      string that the hyperlink is attached to. This will be enough for you to 
      use during the following Lingo experiments we'll go through. Drag this 
      behavior onto your Text member on stage. 
      <P>Once you have ensured that the useHypertextStyles has been set to TRUE 
      and our display behavior is applied to the Text member on stage we can 
      start experimenting. 
      <P>Open the message window and add some data to the Text member like so: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).text = "This is the first line" ¬
  &amp;RETURN &amp; "This is the second line"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You'll need to substitute member(1) for the actual member in the cast. 
      The .hyperlink and .hyperlinks properties are <B>member</B> properties and 
      not sprite properties. This is important to remember. 
      <P>Now let's add a hyperlink to the text. In the Message window enter: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).word[4..5].hyperlink="firstLink"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You should see the words "first line" turn blue and become underlined. 
      Now play the movie and move the mouse over the hyperlink you just created. 
      The cursor should turn into a pudgy hand and if you click on the link you 
      should see... 
      <P><PRE>-- "firstLink"
-- "first line"</PRE>
      <P>...appear in the Message Window. 
      <P>Hyperlinks are applied to chunk expressions. "What's a chunk 
      expression?" you ask. Well, a chunk expression is any Lingo expression 
      that evaluates to a string. Typically this means any Lingo expression that 
      contains line, char or word. So... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>thisMember.word[1]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...is a chunk expression, as is... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>char 3 of word 2 of line 1 of member "foo"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You have a great deal of flexibility when adding hyperlinks to a Text 
      member. You could add them on a character by character basis... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).char[2..15].hyperlink = "a new link"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>by lines... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).line[1].hyperlink = "hyperlinks abound"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>..or even with a combination of commands... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).line[1].word[2].char[2].hyperlink = ¬
  "a very small hyperlink"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Once you have set the hyperlinks in a Text member, you can easily get a 
      list of them by testing the member's .hyperlinks property. Please note the 
      "s". This property is a list of character ranges of each hyperlink. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).word[4..5].hyperlink="firstLink"
member(1).word[8..10].hyperlink = "another link"

put member(1).hyperlinks
-- [[13, 22], [32, 46]]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>There are two things you should pay attention to when using Lingo to 
      set hyperlinks. First, if you set two hyperlinks that are separated by 
      only white space (spaces, carriage returns, etc.) then Director will merge 
      them into one hyperlink using the .hyperlink setting of the second link. 
      So if you enter... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).char[4..5].hyperlink="firstLink"
member(1).char[6..9].hyperlink = "another link"
put member(1).hyperlinks
-- [[4, 9]]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...you will get only one hyperlink. This only occurs if you set the 
      links using character ranges. If you use words or lines, it does not cause 
      the same problem. This is a bug and will most likely be resolved in 
      Director 8. Until then, simply avoid setting links with character ranges 
      if they need to be adjacent. This does <B>not</B> happen if you set the 
      member's hyperlinks using HTML. 
      <P>The second problem is that the hyperlinks in a Text member will be 
      reset if you set the text in that member. Try this: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).text = "This is the first line" ¬
  &amp;RETURN &amp; "This is the second line"
member(1).char[4..5].hyperlink="firstLink"
member(1).char[6..9].hyperlink = "another link"
put member(1).hyperlinks
-- [[4, 9]]

member(1).text = "This is the first line" &amp;RETURN ¬
  &amp; "This is the second line"
put member(1).hyperlinks
-- []</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Director has removed the hyperlinks. There are a few ways around this 
      and the solutions depend on whether you are simply setting links in an 
      existing piece of text or generating the text programatically. 
      <P>The first work around is to build the text in a member in one pass and 
      then build the hyperlinks in another. This works very well if you are 
      building the text and hyperlinks from an external data source (a database 
      or external text file). 
      <P>The second way is to add links to an existing Text member (with the 
      text already in it) or by setting the .text property initially and then 
      adding the links. This is a less than optimal solution as it requires you 
      to predetermine the links and then store that data. Which is tedious. It 
      also makes it more difficult to edit the text or hyperlinks since the 
      links will have to be recalculated. 
      <P>An alternative solution is to append text to the Text member using the 
      put...after and put...before Lingo commands. This does work very well but 
      I do not like using it for several reasons. First it is older Lingo syntax 
      which requires you to mix and match syntax styles. As well the syntax is 
      rather peculiar, especially if you are getting used to or are very 
      comfortable with the new dot syntax. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).text = "a line" &amp; RETURN &amp; "another line"
put RETURN &amp; "a third line" after member 1</FONT></PRE>
      <P>To my mind, member 1 is a direct reference to an actual member in the 
      cast and not to the text of a member. Hence my personal dislike for this 
      particular syntax. But don't for a second let that stop you from using it 
      if you feel comfortable with that style of coding. 
      <P>The final solution involves using some undocumented Lingo to circumvent 
      the problem entirely. Geeky and useful at the same time. 
      <P>There are three undocumented commands that we have available -- 
      setContents, setContentsAfter and setContentsBefore -- but we will only be 
      able to use two of them, as you will see. Credit goes to the 
      ever-resourceful Andrew White for finding these very useful commands. As 
      usual you should always be careful when using undocumented commands as 
      there is no guarantee that they will continue to be supported in Director 
      or even work in the manner they currently do. 
      <P>The commands work in much the manner that you would expect. setContents 
      replaces the text in the text (or field) member, setContentsAfter appends 
      data to the member and setContentsBefore prefixs data to the member. Their 
      use in relation to hyperlinks is that they do <B>not</B> reset the 
      hyperlinks in a Text member when you use them to add or change text. For 
      example: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).text = "This is the first line" ¬
  &amp;RETURN &amp; "This is the second line"
member(1).word[4..5].hyperlink = "first hyperlink"
member(1).word[9..10].hyperlink = "second hyperlink"
put member(1).hyperlinks
-- [[13, 22], [36, 46]]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>That will set two hyperlinks. We know from our previous example that if 
      we set the text of this member again it will remove the hyperlinks. But if 
      we add a line of text to the Text member using setContentsAfter the links 
      will remain. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>thisLine = RETURN &amp; "This is the third line"
member(1).setContentsAfter (thisLine)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Notice that the original two hyperlinks are still there. This works 
      even if we add text to the beginning of the member. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>newLine = "this is a line at the beginning" &amp; RETURN
member(1).setContentsBefore (newLine)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Sadly though, using the setContents function will still replace all the 
      links, so there is no easy way to replace the contents of a text member 
      short of storing the hyperlinks and then rebuilding them again. 
      <P>One way to avoid the problems typically associated with using 
      undocumented Lingo is to wrap the commands in a behaviour. That allows you 
      to still use the commands (in an altered format) but also gives you a 
      modicum of safety as you simply need to rewrite the behavior if the 
      commands "disappear" in the next version of Director. 
      <P>A very quick behaviour that would accomplish this would be: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pMyMember

<B>on beginSprite me</B>
  pMyMember = sprite(me.spriteNum).member
end

<B>on append me, text</B>
  if voidP (text) then exit
  if NOT stringP(text) then exit
  pMyMember.setContentsAfter (text)
end

<B>on prefix me, text</B>
  if voidP (text) then exit
  if NOT stringP(text) then exit
  pMyMember.setContentsBefore (text)
end

<B>on replace me, text</B>
  if voidP (text) then exit
  if NOT stringP(text) then exit
  pMyMember.setContents (text)
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>If you placed this behavior on a Text member and wanted to add some 
      text to the end of the existing data you would use: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>sprite(1).append ("newText")</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Notice that since these commands are accessed via a behaviour they 
      require a <B>sprite</B> reference and not a member reference as all our 
      other examples have used. So to use the functions you would have to call 
      them like so 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>newLine = RETURN &amp; "This is another line of text"
sprite(1).append (newLine)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>You could also use this behaviour to wrap the put...after and 
      put..before syntax into a format that was more consistent with Director 
      7's new dot syntax. Note that even though the examples have used 
      references to all the text in a member, you can actually use these 
      commands to append, prefix or replace any chunk expression. So the 
      following... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).word[1].setContentsAfter("new word")</FONT></PRE>
      <P>... is also a valid way add the words "new word" after the first word 
      of a member. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pros and 
      cons</FONT></H4>
      <P>Using Lingo to set hyperlinks is useful if you have an indeterminate 
      amount of data (you don't know how much) or if you need to test the data 
      to determine what types of data will have hyperlinks added to them. It is 
      also very fast. Compared to the HTML method (see below) it is easily twice 
      as fast. This technique does not, in my mind, work well if you have static 
      text or you want to access text via the web (either from a CGI or a static 
      HTML file.) 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using 
      HTML</FONT></H4>
      <P>But the fun doesn't stop there. You can also set a Text members 
      hyperlinks using HTML. This is done by simply creating an HTML file that 
      contains your text and using HTML anchors to define the links. In exactly 
      the same way that you would write an actual HTML file. Let's assume for a 
      second that we had the following HTML data: <PRE>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;A plain test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is some text with a 
&lt;a href="foo"&gt;hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And this is a second line with 
&lt;a href="some hyperlink text"&gt;yet another link&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</PRE>
      <P>This data is stored in a field called HTMLData. If we wanted to use 
      this as the source of hyperlink data in a Text member (member 1 perhaps) 
      we could simply set the Text member's .html property... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>member(1).html = member("HTMLData").text</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...and be done. Director's HTML rendering engine would parse the HTML 
      data and create the text and the hyperlinks for you. This process is 
      slower than generating the hyperlinks yourself using Lingo. Most of this 
      has to do with the overhead generated by the HTML rendering engine. But 
      the process has some added benefits that make up for this. 
      <P>Using HTML data allows you to access data remotely from a web server 
      without having to do any additional parsing (there is an example of this 
      in the sample movie). You can get data from a CGI and then use that to 
      generate hyperlinks using Lingo, but you would first have to parse the 
      data and clean it up. HTML doesn't have this restriction. 
      <P>Additionally you can use data formatted by other members of your team 
      (read non-programmers) allowing others to modify the data displayed in 
      your movies without having to actually open the movies up. They can also 
      add formatting to the text outside of Director. 
      <P>The HTML files that you use for this purpose <B>must</B> be valid HTML 
      files. Meaning that they have to have well-defined &lt;HTML&gt;, 
      &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags. This isn't too much of a problem if 
      you are retrieving files from a web server but if you are generating the 
      HTML in your Director movie then you will have create the proper header 
      and footer elements yourself. A very easy way to facilitate this is to 
      create two field members with the HTML header and footer information. Then 
      you can use the text in those fields to build your HTML data. 
      <P><B>Basic HTML header:</B> 
      <P><PRE>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;A plain test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;</PRE>
      <P><B>Basic HTML footer:</B> 
      <P><PRE>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</PRE>
      <P>For the purposes of our example let's assume that you have a set of 
      data stored in a field in this example (but it could come from almost 
      anywhere) that is a list of property lists. Each property list has a #link 
      and a #text property. The #text property is a set of HTML tags and text 
      and the #link property is either blank, to indicate no hyperlink or a 
      string to indicate that a link needs to be attached to the accompanying 
      text. This is the format used in the sample movie's first HTML example. 
      <P>So if that data is stored in two fields, HTMLHeader and HTMLFooter, a 
      simple handler to build HTML data from that list would look like so. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on buildHTMLLinks</B>
  
  cursor 4
  
  linkList = value(member("linkText").text)
  
  thisMember = member ("html_temp")
  
  -- add the header
  thisMember.text = member("html_header").text
  
  thisMember.text = thisMember.text &amp; RETURN
  
  -- now go through each element in the link list
  
  repeat with aLinkSet in linkList
    
    addText = ""
    thisLink = aLinkSet.link
    thisText = aLinkSet.text
    
    if thisLink &lt;&gt; "" then
      addText = "&lt;a href=" &amp; QUOTE &amp; thisLink &amp; ¬
        QUOTE &amp; "&gt;" &amp; thisText &amp; "&lt;/a&gt;"
    else
      addText = thisText
    end if
    
    thisMember.text = thisMember.text &amp; addText
    
  end repeat
  
  -- now add the footer
  
  thisMember.text = thisMember.text &amp; RETURN ¬
    &amp; member("html_footer").text
  member ("html").html = thisMember.text
  
  cursor 0
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The true beauty of using HTML is that the HTML data itself can contain 
      formatting information. So while you are building your links you can also 
      be formatting the text that the user will eventually see. 
      <P>BODY attributes, except for bgcolor, are ignored. So you can set the 
      background color of the text member by setting the colour in the bgcolor 
      attribute of the BODY tag but you won't be able to set the link colors 
      that way. If you want more (or even some) control over the appearance of 
      the links, then have a look at James Newton's <A 
      href="http://perso.planetb.fr/newton/" target=_blank>Custom HTML Style 
      movie</A> on his site. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Non-string 
      hyperlinks</FONT></H4>
      <P>Hyperlinks, especially those in HTML data, don't need to be URLs or 
      even just strings. You can make them integers, floats, or even property 
      lists. The Director HTML renderer will not complain in the slightest if 
      you send it HTML data with anchors that look like 
      <P><PRE>&lt;a href="[#link:thisText, #value:23]"&gt;Link #1&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>
      <P>The only catch is that the hyperlinks are stored and returned as 
      strings. So if you want to get the property list (or whatever datatype you 
      used) you will have to check the contents of the hyperlink using the 
      value() function. If the hyperlink is just a string, then value() will not 
      be able to evaluate it and will return VOID. Any other type of data will 
      get "converted" to its correct value. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>thisLink = "[#link:thisText, #value:23]"
thisValue = value(thisLink)
put thisValue
-- [#link: &lt;Void&gt;, #value: 23]
put thisvalue.ilk
-- #propList

thisLink = "aString"
put value (thisLink)
-- &lt;Void&gt;</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This can be added to the basic hyperlink behavior we used earlier. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pMemberRef

<B>on beginsprite me</B>
  pMemberRef = sprite(me.spriteNum).member
end

<B>on hyperLinkClicked me, theHyperLink, range</B>
  
  newValue = value(theHyperLink)
  if voidP(newValue) then newvalue = theHyperLink
  put newValue
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This opens up numerous possibilities. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Summing

      <P>As you can see, not only are hyperlinks quite easy to use and create 
      but they are also very flexible. You can build them using Lingo or with 
      HTML data and you can also generate them using data from external sources. 
      The sample movie includes examples of building hyperlinks from property 
      lists (via HTML), via lists (using preset text), and also getting HTML 
      data from an external server. The sample movie includes enough code and 
      sample data to cover numerous combinations, so download a copy and have 
      some fun testing out new combinations and seeing how you can adapt them to 
      your work.
