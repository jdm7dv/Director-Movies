            Multimedia Handyman</B></FONT> </P>
            <P>I've been for weeks trying to get objects to move across the 
            screen following a sine curve (or a wave line if this is a more 
            accurate description). I have even bought a book on trigonometry. 
            But I am still stumped! Can you help me some pointers as to how to 
            integrate all these beautiful trigonometric functions in my code. 
            <P>Thanks in advance, 
            <P>Patrick Y Bousseton, <A 
            href="mailto:pyb@magna.com.au">pyb@magna.com.au</A> 
            <P><BR>Dear Patrick, 
            <P>For this question, I asked for some expert assistance from a 
            Shockwave Trig programmer extraordinaire, <A 
            href="http://canter.com/mediaband/collins/" target=_top>Jim 
            Collins</A>. Jim responds: 
            <P>Mercy, such a simple little questions that opens a rather largish 
            can o' worms. Trig is a wonderful thing. Feared, misunderstood, 
            under-utilised, under-estimated. There is quite frankly almost no 
            path an object might travel in your wildest imagination, be it 
            straight lines, curves, curls, spirals, corkscrews or any imaginable 
            combination thereof, that can't be at the very least closely 
            approximated with a little trig. Yet use of trig is widely shunned 
            out of math paranoia or mistaken assumptions about the overhead. 
            <P>Trig functions are routine and old hat on all platforms, and have 
            over the years been optimized more than most any common math 
            function. Director is no exception. Its trig is minimal, but fast 
            and efficient. Try making some blob of pixels spin in a circle using 
            the score and try the same thing with a little trig. It will not 
            only move in a true circle, not some bulging, asymmetrical oblate 
            spheroid, but it will be faster to boot. But I still see it 
            pooh-poohed by people who really ought to know better. 
            <P>Take sprite 1... to move it across the screen in a sinusoidal 
            fashion understand that it will need a trig function applied to only 
            one direction of it's motion, up and down. The sprite motion left to 
            right is linear. Assuming it's just off to the left side of the 
            stage we want to apply a simple linear function to move it 
            horozontally <PRE><FONT color=#0033ff>
on enterFrame
  set the locH of sprite 1 to the locH of sprite 1 + 10
end
</FONT></PRE>
            <P>To handle the sinusoidal part you add a bit to the same 
            enterframe handler to set the sprites vertical position based on a 
            trig function. In this case just a simple SIN function is all you 
            need. But to drive it to produce the smooth up and down you need to 
            feed it an artificial angle value that varies over time. Innumerable 
            ways to do that. It just needs to be a numerical value that changes 
            at a constant rate over time, like say the sprites locH. <PRE><FONT color=#0033ff>
on enterFrame
  set the locH of sprite 1 to the locH of sprite 1 + 10
  set myAngle to the locH of sprite 1
  set the locV of sprite 1 to 100*SIN(myAngle) + 100
end
</FONT></PRE>
            <P>The first 100 is because a SIN function returns values between +1 
            to -1 which isn't very far to move so you use a simple multiplier to 
            increase the vertical dimension of the sprites movement. Now the 
            sprites vertical location will oscillate between -100 and +100. 
            Since -100 is off the stage the second 100 added to locV in the 
            enterframe handler simply shifts all the vertical movements up 100 
            pixels. So now the sprites vertical position will oscillate between 
            0 and 200 pixels. 
            <P>The last step is trimming in that angle a bit. One complete cycle 
            of a SIN function returning values from 0 to + 1 down to - 1 and 
            back to 0 requires 360 degrees but in director and most programming 
            languages angles are measured in radians. 2*pi() radians is = to 360 
            degrees. So to get our sprite to do once full SIN bounce we feed it 
            an angle whose value ranges from 0 to 2*pi() or a little less than 6 
            and a half. Using the sprites locH as the angle will have our sprite 
            bouncing up and down like crazy. He will do a complete bounce every 
            time he moves horizonatlly 6.5 pixels. To slow his bouncing down a 
            bit just add a divisor to the locH used for the angle: <PRE><FONT color=#0033ff>
on enterFrame
  set the locH of sprite 1 to the locH of sprite 1 + 10
  set myAngle to the locH of sprite 1/float(50)
  set the locV of sprite 1 to 100*SIN(myAngle) + 100
  updatestage
end
</FONT></PRE>
            <P>bigger divisor = smaller angle = slower bounce 
            <P>Use SIN or COS for this sort of thing depending on where you want 
            your sprite to start. Both osciallet between -1 and +1 and the same 
            rate for a given rate of angular change. But SIN starts at 0 and COS 
            at 1 (both for an angle of 0). You can use anything to feed in the 
            artificial angle, it just should be something that changes at a 
            constant rate, which you can control with a divisor. Time is good, 
            set my angle to the ticks/float(20), or just keep a running counter 
            that you initialize somewhere to say 0. Then <PRE><FONT color=#0033ff>
on enterframe
  set myAngle to myAngle + .2
  set the locH of sprite 1 to the locH of sprite 1 + 10
  set the locV of sprite 1 to 100*SIN(myAngle) + 100
  updatestage
end

            <P>Something smaller instead of .2 and he bounces slower, bigger he 
            bounces faster. </P>
