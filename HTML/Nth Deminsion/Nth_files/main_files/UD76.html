      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>'Things flow about so here!' she said at last in a 
        plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a 
        large bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like 
        a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above the one she was 
        looking at. 'And this one is the most provoking of all -- but I'll tell 
        you what--' she added. as a sudden thought struck her. 'I'll follow it 
        up to the very top shelf of all. It'll puzzle it to go through the 
        ceiling, I expect!'</I> <B><SUP>1</SUP></B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>One of the more often underused and misunderstood programming 
      techniques is recursion. Many languages don't support recursion (which may 
      be why you're not familiar with it) but luckily Lingo does. Even so, you 
      may not be familiar with its uses and strengths. This article is intended 
      to introduce you to the strange world of recursion. With any luck, you 
      will come out the other side feeling more comfortable with the idea, and 
      preferably without feeling like Alice in the Looking Glass World. 
      <P>Most of the time, when you want to do something repeatedly in Lingo, 
      you make a repeat loop and then put the intructions that need to be 
      repeated inside the loop. This is called iteration, and it feels very 
      natural to most people. "Do this with that thing so many times", or as 
      Lingo has it: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>repeat with that = 1 to N
  doThisWith that
end repeat</FONT></PRE>
      <P>When you use iterative processes like this, you mentally stay in the 
      same level the whole time. It might be that inside the loop you call 
      another handler, nesting (or 'popping') one level deeper into the "call 
      stack". In this case, you call the handler 'doThisWith' every time around 
      the loop. 
      <P>When you are constructing this upper level iterative loop, the exact 
      details of the inner workings of 'doThisWith' are not so important (this 
      is the 'black box' principle); you might think of it as a machine to which 
      you are feeding data, in this case, the variable 'that'. 
      <P>If you include a function call inside a repeat loop, you are similarly 
      disinterested in exactly how that function returns a value to the level 
      you are working on. Clearly you may need to attend to the details of that 
      function, but when you do this, you focus your attention almost 
      exclusively on it, ignoring the level above. These kind of abstractions 
      give you the sensation that you are 'inside' a handler, and indeed you are 
      'in' a specific level of the call stack. 
      <P>A more common and obvious example: double clicking on a folder or 
      directory in a Mac or Windows GUI is somewhat like calling a function 
      which returns the location and contents of that folder to be displayed in 
      a window. When you are 'inside' a folder, you are usually only interested 
      in the contents of the folder, not the folder which contains it. 
      <P>Now it's time to break the metaphor altogether. 
      <P>Consider how different it would be if, instead of feeding data to 
      another handler, we feed the data to the handler we are currently 
      'inside': <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on feedMe something
  return feedMe(something)
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This function handler returns the result of a call to itself, which is 
      the result of a call to itself which... will go on forever. Surprisingly 
      enough, this makes logical sense, although this example is quite useless. 
      (Un)fortunately, finite memory resources run out when dealing with 
      infinite recursion. 
      <P>If you type the feedMe handler into a moviescript and then call it from 
      the message window like this; <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>put feedMe ("seymour")</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...you will observe that Director will seize up and then warn you that 
      it has run out of memory. If your computer is feeling particularly 
      fragile, it might go down altogether, so it might be safer not to try this 
      at all. 
      <P>If you are not feeling dangerous, or your computer is a bit flakey, put 
      a breakpoint beside the line <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>return feedMe(something)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...and when you call the handler, you can observe (in the debugger) the 
      call stack getting bigger and bigger like a tumor in your computer's 
      memory. Scary huh? When it gets too worrying (or boring), press stop on 
      the control panel and nothing untoward will occur. 
      <P>The handler calls itself continuously, each time expecting to get a 
      result back, each time getting deeper into the call stack. Eventually, 
      memory runs out and Director complains or crashes. 
      <P>Er... is this actually useful, or am I just messing about with Lingo 
      voodoo? 
      <P>Recursion is only strange if you are relying on the iterative paradigm 
      (doing things in loops), especially if you think of function handlers as 
      machines which take in raw material and then output a result. Think of 
      handlers as processes instead of machines and the landscape is completely 
      transformed. Recursion is actually quite intuitive, even being built into 
      human languages too, though not without a certain amount of confusion, as 
      recursion's chief PR man Douglas Hofstadter points out: 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"The proverbial German phenomenon of the 
        'verb-at-the-end', about which droll tales of absentminded professors 
        who would begin a sentence, ramble on for an entire lecture, and then 
        finish up by rattling off a string of verbs by which their audience, for 
        whom the stack had long since lost its coherence, would be totally 
        nonplussed, are told, is an excellent example of linguistic pushing and 
        popping."</I> <B><SUP>2</SUP></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Another example: Imagine that you are a detective investigating a 
      crime, or an academic researching for a PhD. You might have several leads 
      or avenues of exploration to follow up. You can't follow them all up at 
      once so you start with one, remembering (in your internal call stack) that 
      there are other leads to follow up if the first one bears no fruit. It's 
      likely that some leads will present other leads to explore. This process 
      continues recursively until you have a complete idea of the circumstances 
      or system you are exploring. 
      <P>Following a lead, researching or investigating something is a recursive 
      process. If a lead, path or branch of exploration leads to a worthless 
      result you come back up to where you chose that path and take what's left. 
      This is the essence of a search algorithm, something you may one day be 
      called upon to implement. Recursion will always be a smart strategy for 
      this. 
      <P>This means that, for recursion to be of any use, any recursive function 
      must contain some kind of test to see whether it should call itself again, 
      or whether it should 'come back up' with an actual result. The classic 
      algorithm for illustrating recursion is the factorial. This is a 
      mathematical function, usually denoted by an exclamation mark (!), of 
      tremendous use to statisticians (zzz). It is derived from the formula <PRE>N! = 1 x 2 x 3... x N</PRE>
      <P>...So 5! is equal to <PRE>1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120</PRE>
      <P>This could be done iteratively with Lingo like this: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on iFactorial n
  set r = 1
  repeat with i = 1 to n
    set r = r * i    
  end repeat
  return r
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>or recursively like this: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on rFactorial n
  if n = 1 then return n
  else return n * rFactorial(n-1)
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>These two function handlers return exactly the same set of results but 
      in different ways. Notice how much more compact the recursive version is. 
      It only returns a direct value if the parameter passed to it is 1. If you 
      call this function with the parameter 5 for example: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>put rFactorial(5)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...it will return 5 multiplied by (the result of rFactorial(4) which is 
      (4 multiplied by the result of rFactorial(3) which is (3 multiplied by the 
      result of rFactorial(2) which is (2 multiplied by the result of 
      rFactorial(1) which is (1))))) 
      <P>...which is 120. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=200 src="UD76_files/UD76.gif" width=320> 
      <P>Okay, so what's the big deal. You've used repeat loops for years and 
      you're happy with them, why bother with this weird stuff. You've never had 
      to use a factorial in your life before. What about something more useful? 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MultiDimensional Arrays.</FONT></H4>
      <P>If you have ever used another programming language like BASIC or Java, 
      you will have noticed that, instead of lists, these languages use arrays. 
      Lists and arrays are not quite the same. Arrays are of a fixed size and in 
      most cases can only contain data of the same type. Arrays are created and 
      accessed by specifying their dimensions. 
      <P>Lists, on the other hand can contain data of any type, all coexisting 
      together in peace and harmony if necessary and, most interestingly, they 
      can get bigger and smaller dynamically to accomodate their contents. Lists 
      can be empty one minute and can contain references to all the bitmap cast 
      members in your movie the next. 
      <P>It might appear, then, that lists are superior in almost every respect, 
      but anyone who has built a complex structure of nested lists will 
      appreciate that it is extremely taxing and inconvenient to construct such 
      a thing, and tricky to fetch data from an innermost list because of all 
      the required gymnastics with getat and setat. Sometimes what you really 
      want is an array with known dimensions. It's sometimes just more 
      convenient to refer to an item by a set of coordinates, instead of by a 
      load of complicated nested function calls. 
      <P>Consider a world mapped in Lingo. You'd probably want to map that world 
      in three dimensions. You could build the lists iteratively, but supposing 
      you then want to add time to the system. You'll be adding another nested 
      level to the whole structure. Pretty soon, your code will be a spaghetti 
      of getAt and setAt statements and you'll have to turn the radio off and 
      shout at people so that you can concentrate on 'where you are' in the 
      structure. You'll also be hoping that someone doesn't decide to add 
      parallel universes to the mix. 
      <P>Director 7 has made the process simpler, allowing access to 
      multidimensional lists with a reference like <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>itemIWant = my3DWorld[x][y][z]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>But this still leaves the problem of how to construct multidimensional 
      lists in the first place. 
      <P>Making a script to make an N dimensional array without recursion is 
      hell. Believe me, I've tried it. After several days of sweating, turning 
      the radio off and getting people to be quiet, I gave up. After some time I 
      got a book on LISP and realised that there was a much easier way. 
      <P>LISP is without question the most elegant programming language of all. 
      It is the only one which comes close to the way we actually think. If you 
      ever check it out, you will be surprised at how many Lingo keywords and 
      concepts are borrowed from it, even if you have worked in other languages. 
      It is surely no coincidence that the names of the two languages begin with 
      the same two letters. 
      <P>After playing a little with LISP, I knocked up a multidimensional array 
      in a couple of hours. To do this, I used the basic principle that the 
      function designed to generate an array should call itself with the number 
      of dimensions in the array reduced by one item each time, i.e. the list 
      representing the dimensions of the array becomes continually truncated as 
      the recursion goes deeper. 
      <P>Only when the number of dimensions is reduced to 0 will the recursion 
      start to come up again, returning the values it has gathered and building 
      the array as it goes. This allows arrays of 3, 4 or in fact any number of 
      dimensions, limited of course by the memory available and the solidity of 
      Director's list implementation, which I have experienced to be pretty 
      reliable. 
      <P>This is the workhorse of the script I made, to be used as a general 
      array generator in a moviescript: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- Recursive function to generate 
-- multidimensional array

<B>on generateArray dimensions, fillval</B>
  
  if count(dimensions) &gt; 0 then

    set car = getat(dimensions,1)
    set inner = []
    set cdr = duplicate(dimensions)
    deleteat(cdr,1)
    
    repeat with n = 1 to car
      -- go deeper --
      add inner, generateArray (cdr, fillval) 
    end repeat
    
    return inner

  else 
    
    -- come back up again --
    return fillval
    
  end if
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The parameter 'dimensions' should be a list of integers. The parameter 
      'fillval' is the value which will be used as the default contents of the 
      array. Every slot will contain this value in the beginning. If you leave 
      it out, the array will be filled with void values. 
      <P>I challenge anyone to make a purely iterative equivalent of this 
      handler. Remember it should be capable of making an array of any number of 
      dimensions. Make sure you have the whole day free! [I have learned the 
      hard way that as soon as you say something like this in public someone, 
      usually Andrew White, sends you a three line example that does exactly 
      what you want -Ed.] 
      <P>When you have given up amidst tears of frustration, study the recursive 
      version. It receives the dimensions list, let's say it's [3, 4, 5, 2]. It 
      takes the first item out of the list, then makes a copy of the dimensions 
      list and removes the first item. giving 3 and [4, 5, 2]. This list missing 
      the first item is passed to the same function as many times as there are 
      dimensions specified in the removed first item. The return value of each 
      is added to a list representing the 'current' dimension. This means that 
      the first level of the array is an array of three arrays with dimension 
      [4, 5, 2]. 
      <P>As an example, to generate a four dimensional array of zeroes which is 
      3 x 4 x 5 x 2 items in size, use the following Lingo: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set myArray = generateArray([3, 4, 5, 2], 0)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The local variable names 'car' and 'cdr', by the way, are borrowed from 
      LISP and represent the first item of a list, and a list with the first 
      item removed respectively. Modern LISPs also use the names 'first' and 
      'rest' for the same concepts, but for historical reasons, the names 'car' 
      ("contents of the address register") and 'cdr' ("contents of the decrement 
      register") are maintained to this day. LISP is nearly 40 years old and 
      still in use! 
      <P>This 'first' and 'rest' splitting is the most common recursive 
      technique. The function tests the parameter sent to it, and if it 
      indicates that the bottom of the tree has been reached, it returns a 
      simple result, initiating a climb back up the call stack. If the test 
      indicates that there is more structure to deal with, it removes and 
      processes the first item and then calls 'itself' with the rest of the list 
      it received as a parameter. In pseudo code, a fairly standard recursive 
      algorithm looks like this: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on explore thisInformation

  if thisInformation is finished_empty_completed then 
    -- back up again
    return thisInformation 
  else 
    process theFirstPiece of thisInformation
    -- recursion, deeper into the structure
    explore therest 
  end if
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Recursion then, is often best suited to complex, nested data 
      structures. Most obviously this will be lists, but it might also be 
      strings of XML or a file system. Iteration in these contexts is often a 
      headache. 
      <P>Back to the array example. Considering that you've made your array, you 
      probably want to get and set values inside it. If you're using Director 7, 
      you can use the new syntax mentioned above. In earlier versions you could 
      use a whole bunch of getat and setat calls, but why bother when we can use 
      recursion to simplify the whole process: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- Recursive function to get value 
-- from a multidimensional array

<B>on getVal arr, coords </B> 

  set car = getat(coords,1)
  
  if count(coords) &gt; 1 then
    set cdr = duplicate(coords)
    deleteat(cdr,1)
    
    return getVal(getat(arr,car), cdr) -- go deeper --
    
  else -- get value and come back up again --
    return getat(arr,car)
  end if
  
end

-- Function to set value in 
-- a multidimensional array

<B>on setVal arr, coords, newval</B>
  
  set i = getat(coords, count(coords))
  set truncated = duplicate(coords)
  deleteat(truncated,count(coords))
  setat(getVal (arr, truncated), i, newval)
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>So to get a value from our array it would be something like <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set aValue = getVal(myArray, [1, 2, 2, 1])</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...and to set a value in our array it would be something like <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>setVal(myArray, [1, 2, 2, 1], 99)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Notice that the 'setVal' handler calls the recursive 'getVal' function 
      to get the inner list it requires and then sets the value in the result. 
      In its recursion, it processes the last item of the list rather than the 
      first item, but the principle is the same. 
      <P>This technique, being based on Lingo's very fine list implementation, 
      can contain data of mixed types, unlike arrays in other languages. (Hats 
      off to Macromedia's "J.T.", a known LISP enthusiast.) 
      <P>For those of you who are comfortable with parent scripts, I have made a 
      multidimensional array class (parent script), which you might find easier 
      or cleaner to work with. This is downloadable as a Director file (in Mac 
      or PC format) which also includes a movieScript containing the other 
      examples in this article. The parent script version includes basic error 
      checking and has the added interesting advantage of being able to create 
      an array of runtime evaluated items. 
      <P>More complete documentation is provided with the getBehaviorDescription 
      handler, so you can read it in the behavior inspector. 
      <P>I hope this article will stimulate some interest in recursion, or at 
      the very least provide some useful array code. (I haven't seen really 
      solid multidimensional array Lingo anywhere on the net, which is one 
      reason I have written this article.) 
      <P>Recursion is useful in a large number of situations concerning complex, 
      nested data, such as *ML parsing, search functions, databases and file 
      systems. The mathematicians say that every problem that can be solved with 
      iteration can also be solved with recursion and vice versa. They have 
      proof, too, but they'll be the first to admit that it's usually easier to 
      do it one way than the other. 
      <P>Clearly iteration is more appropriate in many situations, but as soon 
      as you start dealing with nested data structures, it might be worth 
      running through this article again, or even a book on LISP. It could save 
      you days of frustration. 
      <P>You can download a sample movie that demonstrates these techniques in 
      <A href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/UD76.hqx">Mac</A> or
