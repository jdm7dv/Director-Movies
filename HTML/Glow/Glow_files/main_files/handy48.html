            <P>HELP! I need to have a graphic in the middle of the screen and 
            script it so that when the mouse gets closer, a sound starts to fade 
            in, incrementally, and a new graphic begins to glow over it, 
            incrementally. 
            <P>Signed, 
            <P><A href="mailto:rbmm@onramp.com">Help!</A> 
            <P>Dear Help, 
            <P>Remember you high school geometry lesson about calculating the 
            hypoteneus of a right triangle? Time for a review. Let's say that 
            you have a triangle where sides X and Y are at a 90 degree angle. To 
            calculate the length of the third side (Z), this is the formula. 
            <P>X<SUP>2</SUP> + Y<SUP>2</SUP> = Z<SUP>2</SUP> 
            <P>It's fairly easy to postulate that side Z is always longer than 
            either side X or Y. 
            <P>Now, let's apply this to your problem. Imagine a right triangle 
            where the ends of the long side (Z) are defined by the loc of your 
            sprite and the mouseLoc. Side X is the horizontal distance between 
            the locH of your sprite and the mouseH, and side Y is the vertical 
            distance beween the locV of your sprite and the mouseV. Now, the 
            formula above can be modified as follows: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000> 
set x = the mouseH - the locH of sprite whatever
set y = the mouseV - the locV of sprite whatever 
x<SUP>2</SUP> + y<SUP>2</SUP> = the distance<SUP>2</SUP> 
</FONT></PRE>
            <P>That's the concept. Since length should never be negative, when 
            we write the Lingo, we'll use the absolute value property to set the 
            x and y values. Also, I tend to use more descriptive variables for x 
            and y; in this case I'll used hInc and vInc for "horizontal/vertical 
            Increment". 
            <P>The next step will be to correlate the distance to 1) the volume 
            of a sound channel, and 2) the blend of the sprite (the glowing 
            sprite). The volume of sound has a range from 0 to 255, and since we 
            want the sound to increase as the mouse approaches, we could simply 
            set the volume equal to 255 minus the distance. To give you a little 
            more control, I'll create a "fade" property. We'll multiply the 
            distance by the fade property so that the sound fades over a shorter 
            distance. (The higher the fade value, the faster the fade.) 
            <P>Finally, you'll need to set the ink effect for your glowing 
            sprite to BLEND. Then in the behavior, we'll set the blend to 
            correlate to the sound volume. Blend has a range from 1 to 100, so 
            to correlate it to the volume's range of 256 steps, we'll set the 
            blend of sprite to the volume/256. 
            <P>

            <P>Here's the behavior, which you should apply to the sprite which 
            will be "glowing". <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>
