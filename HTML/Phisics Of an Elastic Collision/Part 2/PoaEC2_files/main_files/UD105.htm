      <P>Predicting the future has always been a valued commodity ranging from 
      foreseeing when a drought would occur in agrarian times, to when a stock 
      price will skyrocket in the digital age. Physics is a fascinating science 
      since it lets us do more than just predict the future, we can actually 
      determine the future. In <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/UD_articles/UD96.html">Part 1 
      of this article</A> we learned how to determine the future of two masses 
      moving toward each other. If we know the masses and velocities of two 
      blocks, we used an equation to solve for the velocities in the future 
      (after the collision). Before going any further, I strongly urge you read 
      Part 1 of this article where we learned about many things, including 
      vectors, momentum, and conservation of momentum. 
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>The 2D 
      World</FONT></H4>
      <P>Part 1 of this article taught us the fundamentals of elastic 
      collisions, but as I pointed out, there were a few things that we still 
      need to learn about. One of the most important issues is dealing with the 
      collision angle. The collision angle is the angle made by drawing a line 
      between the center of the two colliding objects (we'll only deal with 
      round things in this article). In a head-on collision the line connecting 
      two objects is horizontal, so that corresponds to an angle of zero 
      degrees. That is rarely the case in the real world. Three cases of 
      colliding objects are shown in the simulation below (think of the 
      simulation as viewing billiard balls from above the table, with the red 
      line showing the current angle between the objects). In Case 1 the blue 
      ball will barely graze the green one, in Case 2 the blue one will strike a 
      bit more cleanly, and in Case 3 you have a head on collision. Before 
      starting each simulation, can you guess what the result might be? Thinking 
      about what happens when playing pool can lead to great insight.

      <P>Were your guesses correct? If not, you probably haven't played enough 
      pool :) With our code from the last article, all three cases would have 
      yielded results identical to Case 3, since we never took the angle of the 
      collision into account (did you notice the varying angles of the red line 
      at the time of the collisions). 
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>Enough 
      concepts, show me the code!</FONT></H4>
      <P>We'll start out with the same code we used in Part 1 of the article, 
      but as we have just seen the angle between the two particles must be taken 
      into account when trying to determine the final velocities. To calculate 
      that angle we will use the position information of each particle, so two 
      lines are added to the reportInformation handler of the collision 
      behavior: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>add tempList, x
add tempList, y
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Since this information is then passed along to the dealWithCollision 
      handler (the handler that determines the final velocities) I add several 
      lines to pull the new information out of the list 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set x1 = getat(infoList1,4)
set y1 = getat(infoList1,5)
set x2 = getat(infoList2,4)
set y2 = getat(infoList2,5)
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>and then proceed to find the collision angle (often called phi) using 
      the arc tangent function 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set dx = x2-x1
set dy = y2-y1
if dx = 0. then
  set phi = pi()/2.
else
  set phi = atan(dy/dx)
end if
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Since pictures are often worth a thousand words I present Figure 1 
      which shows two particles at the time of collision. The angle names used 
      in the Lingo are show in terms of the Greek symbols used in the figure. 
      <P><IMG height=253 alt="" src="UD105_files/figure1.gif" width=431 
      border=0> 
      <P>At this point, we have the x- and y- velocity components of each puck, 
      but we will also need the magnitude of the velocity of each puck (shown as 
      the velocity vectors in Figure 1), and the angle of motion (relative to 
      the standard x-y axes) for each puck. I add several more lines of code to 
      the dealWithCollision handler to calculate these values: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>set term = pi()/180. 
-- used for angle to radian conversions
set v1i = sqrt(v1ix*v1ix+v1iy*v1iy)
set v2i = sqrt(v2ix*v2ix+v2iy*v2iy)
set ang1 = findAnAngle(v1ix,v1iy)*term
set ang2 = findAnAngle(v2ix,v2iy)*term
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>where the findAnAngle handler returns the angle (in degrees) by using 
      the x and y velocity values: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on findAnAngle xthing,ything</B>

  -- very basic angle finder..returns value in degrees
  -- my mind likes degrees, Director likes radians
  
  set term = pi()/180.
  
  if xthing &lt; 0. then
    set t = 180.+ atan(ything/xthing)/term
  else if xthing &gt; 0. and ything &gt;= 0. then
    set t = atan(ything/xthing)/term
  else if xthing &gt; 0. and ything &lt; 0. then
    set t = 360.+atan(ything/xthing)/term
  else if xthing = 0. and ything = 0. then
    set t=0.
  else if xthing = 0. and ything &gt;= 0. then
    set t = 90.
  else
    set t = 270.
  end if
  
  return t
  
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>Angles, 
      angles, everywhere....</FONT></H4>
      <P>Why have we started finding all these angles? When I sat down to write 
      my first collision code I was a bit confused as to how to calculate the 
      velocities after the collision. 1D is relatively simple (after years of 
      graduate school), but textbooks seemed to gloss over the 2D material, and 
      most problems provided so much additional information that going through 
      the full algebraic solution was never required. I finally found the answer 
      in a used textbook which I picked up for a dime. In 1954 Robert Becker 
      <SUP>1</SUP> said, "Newton's Rule (i.e. the conservation of momentum) 
      applies to the components of velocity resolved along the common normal 
      surfaces of the colliding bodies at the point of contact. In the case of 
      the two spheres the velocity components involved are the components 
      resolved along the line of centers during the contact. Consequently, the 
      components of velocity perpendicular to the line of centers will be 
      unchanged during the impact." 
      <P>That statement was the best thing I had seen since sliced bread 
      (although you can see why many consider physics a tad dreary)! Here is my 
      translation: If you view the collision along the line between the two 
      spheres, the velocities along that line will undergo momentum conservation 
      (the same way we calculated the x-components in Part 1), and the 
      velocities perpendicular to that line won't change. Although my words may 
      seem as confusing as Becker's, I have the power of multimedia to show you 
      what I mean, along with the snippets of code (from the dealWithCollision 
      handler) applicable to each picture. 
      <P>We first want to change our mind set from the standard x-y reference 
      frame, to the new reference frame where the x-axis lies along the 
      collision line, and the y-axis is perpendicular to that. The figure shows 
      the new vector components, 
      <P><IMG height=158 alt="" src="UD105_files/step1.gif" width=406 border=0> 
      <P>and the corresponding code is given by: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- find the velocities in the new coordinate system
set v1xr = v1i*cos((ang1-phi))
set v1yr = v1i*sin((ang1-phi))
set v2xr = v2i*cos((ang2-phi))
set v2yr = v2i*sin((ang2-phi))
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>We now use the conservation of momentum to determine the new x 
      velocities in our new reference frame, and the y-components do not change. 
      The figure shows the 'flip-flop' of the x-velocities, 
      <P><IMG height=165 alt="" src="UD105_files/step2.gif" width=425 border=0> 
      <P>and you can see that the code sets the final y velocities equal to the 
      initial values after calculating the final x velocities. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- find the final velocities in the normal reference frame
-- the x velocities will obey the rules for a 1-D collision
set v1fxr = ((m1-m2)*v1xr+(m2+m2)*v2xr)/(m1+m2)
set v2fxr = ((m1+m1)*v1xr+(m2-m1)*v2xr)/(m1+m2)
-- the y velocities will not be changed
set v1fyr = v1yr
set v2fyr = v2yr
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>We now have the 'after collision' velocities, but we have to transform 
      the components back to the standard x-y reference frame. In this 
      particular case, the velocity of the red puck was entirely in the standard 
      y-direction (so our x-velocity in the standard reference frame is zero). 
      <P><IMG height=226 alt="" src="UD105_files/step3.gif" width=422 border=0> 
      <P>The relevant code (once again) is very dependent on angles! 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- convert back to the standard x,y coordinates
set v1fx = cos(phi)*v1fxr+cos(phi+pi()/2)*v1fyr
set v1fy = sin(phi)*v1fxr+sin(phi+pi()/2)*v1fyr
set v2fx = cos(phi)*v2fxr+cos(phi+pi()/2)*v2fyr
set v2fy = sin(phi)*v2fxr+sin(phi+pi()/2)*v2fyr
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>We've now found the velocity of each particle after a collision has 
      occurred! As you could see, angles (along with sines and cosines of many 
      angles) played an important role in the calculation (for learning more 
      about angles stop by ExploreMath.com). With our new and improved collision 
      code things are looking pretty good, but one problem still remains - that 
      of the collision detection (i.e. when exactly should we make the call to 
      the dealWithCollision handler). 
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>Collision 
      Detection</FONT></H4>
      <P>In the previous article we simply looked for the distance between the 
      two objects whenever we step forward in time. That works equally well in 
      this case, but what happens when particles are moving rather quickly or 
      slowly? Two things often happen when just checking for the distances: 1) 
      the particles seem to get stuck together like two things connected by a 
      rubber band (an "internal collision"), and 2) the particles are moving 
      rather quickly and seem to pass through each other on the screen without 
      actually colliding. 
      <P>The first case is due to particles which have slow velocities after a 
      collision (in your code they are still close together after the 
      collision), and the second case is due to the fact that you are not 
      checking for separation distances frequently enough. I'll present two 
      solutions that I have used, and one more which I haven't yet tried, but it 
      should work (consider it a homework problem). 
      <P>In order to deal with internal collisions a frame script can be used to 
      check for collisions (by looking for the distance between two particles) 
      on each exitFrame, deal with the collision when particles first overlap, 
      and then keep track of which particles have not yet separated. The first 
      line of my frame script has a list properties (I tend to avoid 
      globals...but they could just as well be defined elsewhere via globals). 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property particleSpriteList, collidingParticleList, ¬
  numberOfParticles
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The particleSpriteList is a list that contains all the sprites that 
      have the collision script attached to them, and the collidingParticleList 
      will always keep track of which particles are currently in contact. The 
      numberOfParticles property is just the total number of sprites with the 
      collision behavior. On every exitFrame we will now run through all 
      particles with a repeat loop to see who is touching whom. 
      <P>I hard code my test distance here (24). You could also use the width of 
      the sprites when you have particles of varying widths. If the two 
      particles were in the collidingList then remove the pair. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on exitFrame

  repeat with i = 1 to numberOfParticles-1
  
    repeat with j = i + 1 to numberOfParticles
    
      set particleA = getat(particleSpriteList,i)
      set particleB = getat(particleSpriteList,j)
      
      -- we now have selected two particles 
      -- to see if they are colliding
      
      if distance(particleA, particleB) &gt; 24.  then

        if getOne(collidingParticleList,[particleA,particleB]) ¬
          &lt;&gt; 0 then
          deleteAt collidingParticleList, getOne( ¬
            collidingParticleList, [particleA,particleB])
        end if
        
      else
      
        -- if the pair is not in the collidingList, add the 
        -- pair and call the collision script
        
        if getOne(collidingParticleList,[particleA,particleB]) ¬
          = 0 then
          add collidingParticleList, [particleA,particleB]
          dealWithCollision(particleA,particleB)
        end if
        
      end if
      
    end repeat
    
  end repeat
  
  go to the frame
  
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>For most cases that script seems to work rather well when particles are 
      moving with relatively slow velocities, but as things begin to move more 
      quickly a few more lines of code are worth looking at. 
      <P>Another method I have used (to avoid missed collisions) involves 
      additional changes. In the collision behavior I select a very small time 
      step (e.g. set dTime to be 0.01), and rather than just moving the particle 
      once in the exitFrame handler of the collision behavior, I run a repeat 
      loop over small time increments before the position is actually changed on 
      the computer screen. The code is now written as... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on exitFrame me

  if myActivity = TRUE then
  
  repeat with i = 1 to 10 

    checkForCollision spriteNum 
    
    -- this will see if I have hit any other sprites
    
  end repeat
  
    set the loc of sprite spriteNum = point(x,y)
    
  end if
  
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The upper limit of the repat loop (10) can be changed to a higher or 
      lower value. The higher the value the less likely you are to miss a 
      collision, but the code starts to take far longer on the "processing" 
      side. 
      <P>I rewrite my frame script to a basic on exitFrame:go to the frame 
      statement, and convert that frame script (the full one above which 
      contained two repeat loops) to a movie handler: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on checkForCollision aNum</B>

  repeat with j = 1 to numberOfParticles
  
    set A = aNum
    set B = getat(particleSpriteList,j)
    particleA = min(A, B) 
    -- need to sort these to avoid (3,2) vs (2,3) collisions
    particleB = max(A, B)
    
    if particleA &lt;&gt; particleB then
    
      if distance(particleA, particleB) &gt; 24.  then
      
        if getOne(collidingParticleList,[particleA,particleB]) ¬
          &lt;&gt; 0 then
          deleteAt collidingParticleList, getOne( ¬
            collidingParticleList,[particleA,particleB])
        end if
        
      else
      
        if getOne(collidingParticleList,[particleA,particleB]) ¬
          = 0 then
          add collidingParticleList, [particleA,particleB]
          dealWithCollision(particleA,particleB)
        end if
        
      end if
      
    end if
    
  end repeat
  
end
</FONT></PRE>
      <P>We only have one repeat loop at this point (rather than the two in the 
      initial script), but every sprite with the collision behavior calls this 
      on an exitFrame. Also, with this script the particle will often seem to 
      collide without having touched another particle, since so many 
      calculations are performed before the stage is refreshed. Adjusting the 
      dTime and the maximum number of the repeat loop in the collision behavior 
      often lead to a reasonable balance depending on the initial velocities of 
      your particles. 
      <P>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>And for 
      homework...</FONT></H4>
      <P>That is the end of the "tested" material that I use for a lot of my fun 
      stuff, but one other technique (which I've never actually found enough 
      time to test), is to solve for the time at which a collision (tc)between 
      two particles will occur. If you run this test initially (for all 
      particles) and find the shortest time, you could then wait until that time 
      arrives (while particles continue to move at a constant velocity), deal 
      with that collision and perform calculations to find the next time a 
      collision will occur, sit around waiting for the next collision time to 
      occur, etc. The figure shows two particles at a chosen time of t = 0, and 
      the time when a collision would occur. 
      <P><IMG height=184 alt="" src="UD105_files/homework.gif" width=456 
      border=0> 
      <P>In the figure above it is easy to look at the initial positions and 
      velocities and realize the two particles will collide, but trying to 
      determine that fact mathematically is a bit more difficult. The collision 
      time for a pair of particles (with no acceleration) can be written as 
      <P><IMG height=62 alt="" src="UD105_files/timeeq.gif" width=260 border=0> 
      <P>where the variables are defined as, 
      <P><IMG height=116 alt="" src="UD105_files/eqdefs.gif" width=380 border=0> 

      <P>The 1 and 2 subscripts refer to each individual particle, and the 'd' 
      term is the distance between the two particles when the collision occurs 
      (see figure). The equation for the time of the collision only gives a real 
      solution if 
      <P><IMG height=43 alt="" src="UD105_files/valideq.gif" width=334 border=0> 

      <P>so you can see a bit of testing is required when using this method. 
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#cc0000>The real 
      world</FONT></H4>
      <P>Simulating the physical world with a computer language is always a 
      challenge, but when the final product can be used in the classroom and let 
      that 'virtual light bulb' appear over the students, it is worth the 
      effort. This article discussed the techniques that I routinely use, but 
      there are many other methods that could be used for collisional coding. I 
      also didn't discuss frictional forces acting between particles, rotational 
      motion due to the friction, and a variety of other 'annoyances' that occur 
      in the real world.
