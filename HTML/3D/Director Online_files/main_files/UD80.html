      <P>Let's face it: 2D interface and presentation design is being done to 
      death. We're running out of elbow room in this arena of creativity and the 
      only way out is to climb above it all. As processor speed continues its 
      steady ascention, and systems like the iMac begin to flood the low-end 
      userbase, three-dimensional graphics become ever more feasable; the gaming 
      industry realized this a long time ago -- the reason 3D has not been 
      heavily embraced on the web is twofold: Downloading 3D engines, models, 
      and other data takes a long time. Secondly, if you've ever run CosmoPlayer 
      or some other playback engine and tried delving into VRML you've probably 
      found that there's no such thing as a 3D graphics standard on the web; 
      from machine to machine results vary drastically and half the time your 
      system is brought to it knees by some software bug in a plug-in somewhere. 
      Luckily, there's Shockwave. 
      <P>Shockwave/Flash has become ubiquitous on the web - it's solid and 
      rarely ever crashes. The problem is it can't do 3D, right? Wrong. On any 
      computer monitor, 3D graphics algorithms are simply mathematically 
      sophisticated 2D graphics. All depth cues -- shading, blurring, motion 
      parallax -- are simulated by making 2D graphics on the screen colored and 
      positioned correctly to fool you into thinking you're looking at something 
      in three dimensions. As this follows, all you need to do is throw a few 
      math equations in your shockwave movie (note: no big increase in download 
      time) and you've entered the third dimension. It is clear that shockwave 
      is the best vessel for 3D graphics on the web. This article seeks to 
      explain some basic principles of 3D graphics and how you can apply them to 
      your Director movies. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Crash Course 
      in 3D Graphics Theory </FONT></H4>
      <P>It all begins with a point in space. 3D graphics are often made of 
      models. These models are made from polygons. These polygons are 
      represented by their vertices. These vertices are often represented as 1x4 
      arrays -- x, y, z location, and the homogeneous coordinate w (I won't go 
      too deeply into w&#8230; suffice to say that it makes the math easier, and is 
      usually set to 1.0). The actual units used are irrelevant. Each model is 
      defined as a set of points in its own individual local coordinate system, 
      and must be translated, rotated, and scaled into its position in the world 
      coordinate system which is relative to the user's view. Every rotation, 
      translation, and scaling operation is often performed using well-known 4x4 
      matrices in which every step in the transformation process multiplies a 
      4x4 matrix by another 4x4 matrix. The resulting matrix is called the 
      ModelView matrix, because it holds the transformations to move Models 
      around the virtual world, as well as data defining what the Viewer's 
      virutal camera is positioned to capture. More on this later. 
      <P>After the final 4x4 matrix has been determined, you multiply every 
      point's coordinates, a 1x4 matrix, against the final 4x4 matrix and this 
      determines its new location in 3D space. This result is then multiplied 
      against another 4x4 matrix known as the Projection matrix. This operation 
      simulates what a camera lens does to a ray of light from the 3D world as 
      it intersects 2D film. The final operation, called a Viewport 
      transformation, stretches the resulting coordinates to fit whatever window 
      size you have established on the user's screen. The result is a 1x4 array 
      for each point where the x and y values determine where on the screen the 
      pixel is to show up (the locH and locV if you will), the z value is 
      normalized between 1 and -1 indicating how far (or near) from the screen 
      it is, and w is 1.0 (like I said, don't worry about w). This operation 
      occurs for every vertex in the 3D world, for every frame of animation. 
      <P>Lost? If so, it's ok - it's as easy to get lost in graphics theory as 
      it is hard to explain it in layman's terms. Luckily, you don't have to 
      worry much about the math - I've already written a robust 3D lingo engine 
      for you to use. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dave's 3D 
      Engine</FONT></H4>
      <P>This <A href="http://www.dubbus.com/devnull/3D/" 
      target=_blank>engine</A> comes in two flavors: One for D6 and one for D7. 
      Unfortunately, the version for Director 6.5 and D6 does not contain lingo 
      calls to draw &amp; color simple polygons. As a result, the next easiest 
      thing is to use the vertices to define sprite positions on the stage as 
      opposed to defining polygons, using the z-depth information to 
      appropriately scale the sprite, change its blend values, and/or change the 
      member of the sprites. This technique can create fairly convincing 3D 
      effects. This is how Dave's 3D Engine for D6 operates. I call this method 
      of 3D "point-based" 3D. 
      <P>The engine for D7, what I call the "3DE7", has added support for 
      polygonal 3D graphics, since D7 has the wonderful Quad feature which 
      allows you to stretch a given bitmap sprite at any of the four corners of 
      the bitmap. This allows for pseudo texture-mapped 4-vertex polygons. For 
      the remainder of this article I will refer to this method of 3D as 
      "polygonal 3D". 
      <P>There are two script cast members that are common to both engines. The 
      first is a movie script that holds all the handlers which perform the 
      actual 3D work and which automate numerous aspects of authoring 3D 
      graphics for you. It's loosely modeled after the popular (and superior) 
      graphics API OpenGL - in fact, I recommend referring to an OpenGL manual 
      while using Dave's 3D Engine. This script is named "3DEngine." 
      <P>The second cast member is a parent script called "3DSprite." This cast 
      member is what allows point-based 3D to happen. One instance of a 3DSprite 
      represents one 3D sprite channel. 
      <P>Dave's 3D Engine v7 for Director 7 gives you three additional parent 
      script cast members. 3DQuad, which is pretty much like 3DSprite except it 
      stretches a sprite's Quad for the purposes of representing polygonal 3D. 
      The next member, 3DModel, is what makes life easy for you. It encapsulates 
      both the 3DSprite and 3DQuad behaviors so that you don't have to get your 
      hands dirty. With it, you can load 3D models in from a variety of 3D Model 
      file formats, and it will generate the set of 3DSprites or 3DQuads which 
      are required to represent the model you've imported. You can then 
      manipulate the whole collection of sprites through one easy interface. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=173 src="UD80_files/UD80_5Cast.gif" 
      width=350> 
      <P>The remainder of this article will explain how to use this engine to 
      create a simple 3D interface, covering step by step some of the principles 
      of 3D graphics theory. We'll do a step-by-step example of how to make a 
      simple 3D movie with the engine -- after you run through this example you 
      should have a firm hold on the concepts involved in order to create more 
      complex movies. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 0: The 
      Plan </FONT></H4>
      <P>What we'll be doing in this example is creating a four-sided pyramid 
      that will float in the center of the screen. When the user clicks and 
      drags on that pyramid, it will spin accordingly. 
      <P>When you download the 3D Engine, you receive an example movie with some 
      code detailing some of the basic functionality of the engine. Linked to 
      this movie is an external cast called "3DE7.cst". To create your own movie 
      with the 3D Engine, simply import this external cast, or cut &amp; paste 
      the members into the internal cast of your movie (this is a better idea if 
      you want to Shock any of your content). 
      <P>Create a movie that is 400x400 and import the 5 cast members of the 3D 
      Engine as you choose; these 5 members reside in the 3DE7.cst file 
      distributed with the Dave's 3D Engine release archive. Set the background 
      color of the movie to black or dark grey. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=138 src="UD80_files/UD80_bitmaps.gif" 
      width=159> 
      <P>Put any two bitmap images of your choice in the cast. Make sure they're 
      not too big. I recommend making one just a single blue pixel, and making 
      the other a picture of something. Call the first one "bitmap1" and the 
      second one "bitmap2". We'll use these as textures for our model. For every 
      polygon in the model, there is one Quad needed to represent that polygon. 
      These bitmaps will be fit to every Quad in the model we'll use. 
      Unfortunately, right now there is no way to take a single bitmap and 
      stretch it across several Quads, so we have to apply one bitmap to every 
      polygon quad in our 3D Model. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 1: 
      Setting Up the Score &amp; Initializing the 3D Engine </FONT></H4>
      <P><IMG align=left alt="" border=0 height=572 hspace=4 
      src="UD80_files/UD80_score.gif" vspace=4 width=177> There's no rule that 
      says you can't do otherwise, but how I typically set up the score in using 
      Dave's 3D Engine is to loop on a single frame - in this particular case it 
      makes sense since all our graphics are going to be controlled with lingo. 
      So, in frame 5 of your movie, set up a frame script to "go to the frame". 
      <P>Now, with the inception of D7, you don't have to put placeholder 
      sprites in the sprite channels you are planning on using for 
      3DSprite/3DQuad objects, however, it is sometimes helpful to put a sprite 
      there to avoid at times unpredictable ink effects and such. I often just 
      make a pixel bitmap in the paint window and stick it offscreen. The 3D 
      engine will replace the sprite and reposition it as needed. In this case, 
      we'll be creating a 3D Model that will be a pyramid with four sides and a 
      base. That's 5 surfaces, which means 5 3DQuad objects, which means 5 
      sprite channels you'll need to allocate. Let's allocate sprite channels 11 
      through 15, starting at frame 3. 
      <P>The 3D Engine will need to be initialized. This involves setting up the 
      Projection matrix with the correct viewing Frustum. A Frustum is a 
      definition of the volume that determines which objects are visible (within 
      the camera view) and which are not. It defines the top, bottom, left, 
      right, furthest and nearest edges of the area that defines where objects 
      come into view. It's equivalent to choosing a lens on a camera. A wider 
      viewing frustum creates wide-angle lens effects. A more narrow one acts 
      like a telephoto lens. Here is a diagram of a frustum: 
      <P>We want to define a frustum that has the same aspect ratio as our 
      viewport. A viewport is the actual 2D window that the 3D world is shown 
      within. We'll make our viewport (or view window) 400x400, the stage size, 
      and our frustum of a square aspect ratio, with an average viewing volume. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=260 src="UD80_files/UD80_Frustum.gif" 
      width=370> 
      <P>The viewing volume of the frustum is the area that is between the 
      top,bottom, left, right, far, and near planes that describe the viewing 
      frustum. This volume you could imagine looks like a pyramid with the top 
      chopped off with a base that grows away from the viewer. Only vertices 
      that lie within this volume will be shown on the screen, everything else 
      will not be shown because it is presumed to be outside of the reach of the 
      lens of the virtual camera. 
      <P>At frame 1, create a score script with the following code: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on exitFrame

 mSelectMatrix("Projection")
 mLoadIdentity()
 pFrustum(-0.9, 0.9, 0.9, -0.9, 0.7, 200.0)
 pViewPort(0,0,400,400)
 mSelectMatrix("ModelView")
 mLoadIdentity()
 
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>I'll explain line by line what this code does: 
      <OL>
        <LI>mSelectMatrix selects which matrix to edit. There are two possible 
        matrices we could edit, the Projection matrix which defines how the 
        viewing is done, and the ModelView matrix which determines how objects 
        are placed and oriented in the virtual world. We wish to edit the 
        Projection matrix. 
        <LI>mLoadIdentity sets the matrix to an identity matrix - the matrix 
        equivalent of setting a coeffieicent to 1. 
        <LI>The pFrustum call sets up the Projection matrix to represent a 
        frustum that is of average width and height, the same aspect ratio as 
        the viewport, and clips all objects which are closer than 0.9 units from 
        the camera, and farther than 200 units from the camera. Clipping is the 
        act of deciding not to draw an object because it falls outside of the 
        camera view. Feel free to play with these values later, particularly the 
        0.9, for different perspective effects. 
        <LI>pViewPort defines a viewing window that is the size of the stage. 
        <LI>The next two calls simply ensure that any further transformation 
        calls will be applied to the ModelView matrix and sets the matrix to the 
        identity matrix, which means that no transformations are saved in the 
        ModelView matrix. </LI></OL>
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 2: 
      Setting Some Initial Global Variables </FONT></H4>
      <P>The "3DEngine" cast member in the 3DE cast member bundle has a 
      prepareMovie script. You'll notice if you examine it that there are a few 
      global variables that are set in there. You can either override their 
      default values in a script that's executed after the prepareMovie event, 
      or change this code right inside the engine (don't be afraid to poke 
      around!). The global variables you might want to pay attention to are: 
      <UL>
        <LI><B>cullBackfaces</B> -- This global variable, when set to TRUE, 
        enables backface culling. What backface culling does is decides that 
        polygons have a front face, and a back face. Generally there is 
        something in the definition of the polygon that indicates this. In many 
        cases, polygon vertices are defined in a clockwise manner, and 3D 
        engines assume that if the viewer sees a polygon's front face, then its 
        vertices can be observed in the same clockwise manner as the polygon was 
        defined in; D3DE7 uses this convention. Therefore, if the polygon's 
        front face is not facing the viewer, the engine will decide not to draw 
        that polygon at all. This is a good idea to enable if you know you've 
        defined your polygons correctly, since it makes them appear a little 
        more realistic on the screen as well as saves some blit time. However if 
        you're not sure that you set up your polys correctly, you might want to 
        disable this 
        <LI><B>cullBackfaces_cw</B> -- When set to TRUE, this determines that 
        all polygons will be front facing when their vertices appear to be 
        defined in a clockwise order. When set to FALSE, front facing polygons 
        are assumed to have their vertices defined in a counter-clockwise order. 
        This is useful for turning objects "inside out". Once we've created this 
        example, flip the value and take a look. 
        <LI><B>use3DWatcher</B> -- The 3DWatcher is a parent script I wrote 
        which is enabled automatically by creating a 3DQuad. What it does it 
        watches the 3D world for any changes you've made since the last frame 
        was drawn - if no changes were made, it doesn't call for the 3D Engine 
        to do anything that frame. This saves on computation time for other 
        non-3D elements of your movie. When set to TRUE, the 3DWatcher is 
        enabled. Sometimes, for reasons beyond the scope of this article, the 
        3DWatcher can think that no change is necessary when one actually is 
        necessary. I recommend setting this to FALSE while you develop, and then 
        once you're done, turning it on to and see if nothing breaks. </LI></UL>
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 3: 
      Creating a Model </FONT></H4>
      <P>In this example, we're going to use the 3DModel parent script to 
      generate the model from a field cast member that we're about to create. 
      <P>The first step is to define the model within a field cast member using 
      a format I created called .D3D -- this model format will define, face by 
      face, a pyramid shaped model. Each face we'll assign an ink value, blend 
      value, bitmap member to fill in the polygon. We'll also define the 
      vertices of each face in a clockwise fashion to indicate to the 3D engine 
      that its front face is facing outward. 
      <P>Here is the pyramid in .D3D format. Create a field member called 
      "Pyramid.D3D" and paste this in: <PRE>  
-- Pyramid.D3D - defined around its own center
-- base face: bkg transparent ink, 100% 
-- blend, bitmap cast member 
-- don't worry what 0 means for now 

-- base 
  NEWFACE 36 100 0 bitmap2
  -10, -5, 10 
  10, -5, 10 
  10, -5, -10 
  -10, -5, -10 
 -- front 
  NEWFACE 36 100 0 bitmap1
  -10, -5, 10 
  0, 5, 0 
  0, 5, 0 
  10, -5, 10 
 -- back 
  NEWFACE 36 100 0 bitmap1
  10, -5, -10 
  0, 5, 0 
  0, 5, 0 
  -10, -5, -10 
 -- left 
  NEWFACE 36 100 0 bitmap2
  -10, -5, -10 
  0, 5, 0 
  0, 5, 0 
  -10, -5, 10 
 -- right 
 NEWFACE 36 100 0 bitmap2
  10, -5, 10 
  0, 5, 0 
  0, 5, 0 
  10, -5, -10 </PRE>
      <P>This is an excellent opportunity to introduce the concepts of the World 
      Coordinate System (WCS) versus each object's Local Coordinate System 
      (LCS). Each model is defined in its own local coordinate system that has 
      nothing to do with the 3D world. The units in both systems are arbitrary. 
      The models are then positioned in the World Coordinate System along with 
      all the other models. 
      <P><IMG alt="" border=0 height=300 src="UD80_files/UD80_lcs.gif" 
      width=300> 
      <P>There is an LCS for every model, but only one WCS. In the "Pyramid.D3D" 
      field above, the reason that the "front" face is called the front face 
      here is due to the nature of the WCS. By default, the virtual camera sits 
      at the origin of the WCS and points down the negative Z axis. Without any 
      transformations applied to the pyramid model (or any model), it will also 
      be drawn at the origin of the WCS, oriented such that what is called the 
      front face of the pyramid would face the camera. I say would because at 
      this point the camera and the model are in the same place, so the camera 
      is inside the pyramid. If you were to slide the model back along the Z 
      axis, then the front face would face the viewer. 
      <P>Envisioning this situation, I defined the polygons of the pyramid in a 
      clockwise order as they would appear if I were looking at them head on. 
      This way I can enable backface culling for a cleaner result. 
      <P>Now we must create a lingo script to represent this object. Create a 
      new parent script, call it "Pyramid". This script will encapsulate the 
      model, representing both its visual status and its interactivity. In the 
      constructor handler, we'll import the .D3D model. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property model
global rotX, rotY

on new me
 model = new (script "3DModel", 1, "Pyramid.D3D", ¬
   11, 15)
 rotX = 0
 rotY = 0
 add the actorlist, me
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>First we set up some properties, rotX and rotY which we will use for 
      interactivity later. We keep the model property around to hold a pointer 
      to the 3DModel object. The call to create a new 3DModel takes the argument 
      1, which tells the 3D model a .D3D file is coming (you can choose other 
      numbers for other formats, see the docs), the name of the field that 
      defines the Pyramid, and then the range of sprite channels the model is 
      allowed to occupy, 11-15. We then add the Pyramid object to the actorlist 
      so it can receive stepFrame events. Make sure that on stopMovie you're 
      setting the actorlist = []. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 4: Adding 
      Interactivity</FONT></H4>
      <P>This is a very simple step. All we aim to do here is provide the 
      interface with which the user spins the pyramid. We'll go for a click n' 
      drag approach. Create a quickdraw box cast member that covers the stage -- 
      make it a non-filled quickdraw box with a line width of 0. Put it in 
      sprite channel 20. Attach a behavior to it. This behavior will track the 
      mouse's movements and modify the global variables rotX and rotY, which 
      we'll use as arguments later to move the pyramid. 
      <P>Your behavior should look like this: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>global rotX, rotY

on mouseDown me
 
 y = the mouseH
 x = the mouseV
 oldRotX = rotX
 oldRotY = rotY
 
 repeat while the stilldown
  rotX = oldRotX + (the mouseV - x)
  rotY = oldRotY + (the mouseH - y)
  updateStage
 end repeat
 
end</FONT></PRE>
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 5: 3D 
      Transformations</FONT></H4>
      <P>This is the part of the article where we actually affect the 3D model's 
      position in space. Now that we have a way to interactively change the rotX 
      and rotY values, we need to plug them into the 3D engine's transformation 
      calls. 
      <P>Simply put, a transformation is anything that potentially affects the 
      position of a vertex in space. It can, for instance, be a translation, a 
      rotation, or a scaling procedure. In this case we will be modifying the 
      pyramid's rotation. 
      <P>After any model has been properly transformed to its correct position 
      in the world coordinate system (known as a model transformation) that 
      model must be then transformed again to represent the virtual camera's 
      position and orientation. The idea of positioning a camera is really a 
      falsehood. What you are in actuality doing is moving every model in the 
      world coordinate system, one at a time, to a new space in the world 
      coordinate system to fake the idea that a camera is being moved. For 
      instance, by default the view of the 3D engine is positioned at the origin 
      of the world coordinate system looking down the negative Z axis. In some 
      respects it always is. If you position several models, say, -30 units away 
      from the origin on the Z axis, and then translate them to -50 units away 
      from the origin on the Z axis, the appearance to the viewer is that the 
      camera is moving away from the objects 20 units. In reality, it is the 
      objects that have moved. This is how it is with moving a virtual camera in 
      3D. 
      <P>The general rule is, first make the transformations to position your 
      models in space, after which we'll make the camera transformations. First 
      do your rotations to orient the model, then do your scaling if needed 
      (often it is not), then do your translation to position your model in the 
      world coordinate system. After all this, now perform your camera 
      transformations. To move your camera "forward" --translate all your models 
      back; to move your camera left, translate all your models right. The same 
      rotation calls you made to orient your model, now that it has been 
      translated to the right place in the WCS, will cause your models to orbit 
      around the origin of the world coordinate system (technically where your 
      camera is always located). Rotations always happen around the center of 
      the WCS - if your model is not centered on the WCS origin then it will 
      appear to orbit around the origin instead of spin on its own center. 
      <P>That having been said, we will write the code to move the pyramid. 
      We'll do this using the stepFrame event. Write this into the code of your 
      container script for the Pyramid, "Pyramid". <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on stepFrame me 

  --  step 1 - "erase" ModelView matrix  
  mLoadIdentity() 
  
  --  step 2 - since the pyramid is defined sitting at 
  -- the origin, orient the pyramid  
  xRotateX(rotX/100.0)  
  xRotateY(rotY/100.0) 
  
 --  step 3 - translate the pyramid 30 units down the -Z axis   
 --  this is the same as moving the camera 30 units back 
 -- along the positive Z axis   
  xTranslate(0, 0, -30.0) 
  
 --  step 4 - Multiply the vertices of our model against 
 -- the resulting ModelView matrix  
  Transform(model)  
  
 --  step 5 - Draw the model with its newly transformed vertices.  
  drawMe(model) 
  
end </FONT></PRE>
      <P><B>Step 1 </B>of this script does is sets the ModelView matrix, the 4x4 
      matrix I mentioned earlier to an identity matrix. This is the mathematical 
      equivalent of not performing any transformations -- wiping the slate 
      clean. One approach to 3D animation is to do this every frame and then 
      reposition every model all over again for every frame of the animation. 
      Another approach never initializes the ModelView matrix between frames and 
      uses the cumulative transformations to move the geometries -- but we're 
      not going to use that one for this example. 
      <P><B>Step 2</B> then applies the rotation global variables rotX and rotY 
      to the rotation transformation handlers. I divide these values by 100 
      because we're going from pixel difference to radians -- not doing this 
      would cause the pyramid to spin wildly. The pyramid will spin on its 
      origin because the model is defined around its own origin in its local 
      coordinate system and has not yet been translated away from the origin of 
      the world coordinate system. This is technically our "model" 
      transformation. 
      <P><B>Step 3</B> then moves the model 30 units down the -Z axis -- which 
      is equivalent to backing the camera off the model 30 units. This is 
      technically our "viewing" transformation. Note that both step 2 and 3 have 
      affected the ModelView matrix -- it is the order that is important. 
      <P><B>Step 4</B> actually multiplies the local coordinate system vertices 
      of the model against the modelView matrix and the projection matrix, and 
      saves the results within the model datatype. These results are either each 
      vertex's transformed locH and locV on the screen (viewport) or 0 if the 
      vertex has been translated outside of the viewing frustum and hence is 
      offscreen. 
      <P><B>Step 5</B> finally draws each polygon of the model based on its 
      locally stored transformed vertices. If a vertex is outside of the viewing 
      frustum, that polygon is not drawn. This is known as clipping. The idea of 
      clipping is a powerful one because it means that you can define a whole 
      virtual universe and only the portions of the universe that appear within 
      the viewing frustum will be drawn. All the processor time it would have 
      taken to blit the image is not allocated. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 6: 
      Z-Sorting </FONT></H4>
      <P>We could add a further step to the drawing cycle of our pyramid which 
      would ensure that the sprites which represent the frontmost surfaces will 
      be assigned a higher locZ property so as to always properly appear on the 
      screen. After all, it would be a bit embarrasing to have the rear polygons 
      of a model starship, for instance, be drawn on top of the front ones. 
      <P>This feature is easily enabled by setting a global variable called 
      "sortSprites" to TRUE. Do this in prepareMovie and the 3DModel object of 
      the 3DE7 is smart enough to make a call to the engine's zSort() handler 
      for that model. This variable is already set to TRUE by default in the 
      prepareMovie handler of the engine. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tying up the 
      loose ends</FONT></H4>
      <P>All you have to do now is instantiate the object. Since you are looping 
      on frame 5 of your score, create a frame script in frame 4. This script 
      will instantiate the 3D model and get things underway. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>global pyramidHandle 

on exitFrame 
  pyramidHandle = new(script "Pyramid") 
end </FONT></PRE>
      <P>That should do it. Make sure rotX and rotY are set to 0 in the 
      prepareMovie handler, rewind, press play, and you should have a pyramid 
      sitting in front of you! If you click and drag over the pyramid (where you 
      have placed your invisible quickdraw character), you should be able to 
      "spin" the pyramid interactively. You have now scratched the surface of a 
      much larger 3D framework. Using the basic skills you have learned in this 
      article, you should be able to go on and create far more complicated 3D 
      environments to suit your needs. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is This The 
      Only Way? </FONT></H4>No. As my graphics professor put it, don't be a 
      slave to your mathematical system -- you create your mathematical system 
      to be subjugate to your needs. There are many ways in which you can 
      represent the math needed to render 3D graphics; it just happens that the 
      path I have taken is one of the most versatile, adaptable, scalable, and 
      widely written-about methods humanity knows about today. If you are 
      daring, and your needs don't require such a generalized system, feel free 
      to explore your own avenues; you might come upon a faster, more 
      streamlined way to do what you need to do -- but if you ever want to 
      expand an existing system troubles could creep in. Explore the links 
      below, widen your horizons, and make your own decisions. Personally, I 
      find the exploration of new ways to express mathematical concepts in 
      artistically enticing ways to be the driving impetus behind my work; 
      Leonardo DaVinci followed this path and look where it got him.
