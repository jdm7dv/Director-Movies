      <P>You've just finished your cool new shockwave game when it hits you: the 
      player needs to save her progress. Unfortunately, your game is pretty 
      complex, and you need to save more than just a few high scores and names; 
      you need to save objects, and you can't just write out objects using 
      setPref() like you can with numbers and strings. Should you scrap the 
      whole project? Is it too nightmarish a task to go on? 
      <P>Actually, it's pretty simple, if you know how to prepare for it, and 
      have a few powerful functions under your belt. (In fact, these routines 
      can be used anytime you need to save and restore the state of your 
      application.) Let's take a look at some game state saving strategies! 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before we 
      begin</FONT></H4>
      <P>This article assumes: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>You are using Director 7.02 or greater. 
        <LI>You can save and read files (using either setpref()/getpref() or 
        FileIO. 
        <LI>You are familiar with linear and property lists. 
        <LI>You are familiar with creating objects from parent scripts. </LI></UL>
      <P>If you don't know how to save and restore information, check out Mike 
      Weiland's article <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/accessArticle2.cfm?id=329" 
      target=_top>Saving a User's State from a Shockwave Movie</A>. Code for 
      reading and writing files is omitted from the examples. For linear lists, 
      property lists, and object scripts, see the Director Manual. Also, there 
      is a an article by Zac on <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/accessArticle2.cfm?id=25" 
      target=_top>debugging object-oriented programming</A> which may come in 
      useful and covers some similar topics. 
      <P>Finally, save your fingers! All the code is already available in an 
      example movie which you can download in <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/UD85.hqx">Mac</A> or <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/UD85.zip">PC</A> format. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      problem</FONT></H4>
      <P>We want to save the state of our game to a text file, and then read it 
      back in to pick up the game later. Actually writing our information out to 
      disk and reading it back in is almost trivial; the hard part is preparing 
      the data that needs to go out to disk. 
      <P>Saving a player's name and high score is easy. But what happens when we 
      are using objects in our game? You can't just use setPref() to save an 
      object, because we would somehow have to translate it to a string. 
      Instead, we'll devise a way to represent an object as a list which we 
      <B>can</B> output as a string using the string() function. 
      <P>If we want to be able to restore an object from a game, we need to 
      store two things for later use. First, we need to know which parent script 
      to create the new object from, and second, we need to know what to set the 
      properties to. If we can find a way to cajole this information out of any 
      given object, we can write a generic object-saving handler. 
      <P>Let's take these two items in order. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finding the 
      Script Name</FONT></H4>
      <P>There is no easy way to get the script name of an object; there is no 
      built-in Lingo function that you can pass an object to and get the 
      scriptname back. However, there is a sneaky way to get the scriptname. The 
      key comes from this observation in the message window: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>g = new(script "test")
put g
-- &lt;offspring "test" 2 af7f8e8&gt;
put string(g)
-- "&lt;offspring "test" 3 af7f8e8&gt;"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Notice that the string() function applied to an object returns a string 
      which contains the name of the script used to create the object. Thus, we 
      can extract the scriptname using a simple function: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>  -- scriptName
  -- Returns the name of the script used to create an object.
  -- Returns an empty string if not passed an object.

  <B>on scriptName obj</B>
  
    oldDelimiter = the itemDelimiter
    the itemDelimiter = QUOTE
    scriptName = item 2 of string(obj)
    the itemDelimiter = oldDelimiter
    return scriptName
    
  end scriptName</FONT></PRE>
      <P>(This routine could be shortened to two lines, but since the 
      itemDelimiter is set across your entire environment, it is safer to set it 
      back to whatever it was when we entered the handler. If you're careful to 
      always set the itemDelimiter before referring to items, you can just set 
      the itemDelimiter and return the scriptname immediately.) 
      <P>This routine, if passed an object, returns a string containing the 
      scriptname used to create the object. It's pretty bulletproof, returning 
      an empty string if passed a non-object. (It <B>will</B> choke on objects 
      which were created from scripts containing quotes in the script name, but 
      if that is a concern for you, that is simple enough to fix, and is left as 
      an exercise for you.) 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Restoring 
      Properties</FONT></H4>
      <P>The next task is to get a list of the properties and their values so we 
      can restore their values when we restore the object. This is where a 
      certain Lingo feature comes in really handy: <B>properties of objects can 
      be read as if they were property lists</B>. 
      <P>For example, say our "test" script has one property named myprop, and 
      it defaults to "ABC". Then you could type the following in the message 
      window: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>g = new(script "test")
put g.count
-- 1

put getpropat(g,1)
-- #myprop

put getAProp(g,#myprop)
-- "ABC"</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This gives us all we need to write a generic handler for translating a 
      simple object into a list that can be stored away. 
      <P>Objects with ancestors are somewhat problematic, however. It is 
      possible to save ancestral properties, too, but that is beyond the scope 
      of this article (but see the <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/UD_articles/UD85.html#further">Further 
      Explorations</A> section at the end of this article for some notes!). 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Objects as 
      Lists</FONT></H4>
      <P>Here's how we can convert an object to a list. First, we find out how 
      many properties the object has using the count function. Then, we step 
      through them, one by one, building a new property list with the same 
      properties of the object. If we store the scriptName (obtained from the 
      handler above) as one of the properties, then we can use that later to 
      determine the parent script when we restore our game. Here's how it is 
      done: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>  -- objectToList()
  -- Takes an object and returns a property list
  -- The property list includes the scriptName.
  
  <B>on objectToList what</B>
  
    z = [:]
    propTotal = what.count
    
    repeat with looper = 1 to propTotal
      propName = getPropAt(what,looper)
      addProp(z,propName,getAProp(what,propName))
    end repeat
    
    addProp(z,#scriptName,scriptName(what))
    return z
    
  end objectToList</FONT></PRE>
      <P>This routine generates a property list that has as its properties the 
      properties of the object that is passed to it, and one special property 
      called #scriptName that has our object's script name. We now have all the 
      information we need to restore the object. First, we look up the 
      #scriptName property for the name of the script to create an instance of. 
      Then, we simply step through and set the object's properties. Here's how: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>  -- listToObject()
  -- Takes a property list with a #scriptName property
  -- and returns an object
  
  <B>on listToObject what</B>
  
    sName = getAProp(what,#scriptName)
    theObj = new(script sName)
    listCount = what.count
    
    repeat with looper = 1 to listCount
      propName = getPropAt(what,looper)
      if (propName &lt;&gt; #scriptName) then theObj[propName] = ¬
        getAt(what,looper)
    end repeat
    
    return theObj
  end listToObject</FONT></PRE>
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Game saving 
      strategies</FONT></H4>
      <P>So now you have a routine for storing a single object! However, many 
      games will have more information than just the properties of a single 
      ancestor-less object! Let's construct a way of saving our entire game 
      state easily. 
      <P>Suppose your game consists of a player going around collecting weapons 
      and treasures. You might have a player object, objects representing the 
      treasures the player has collected, and a few "loose" global variables 
      that need storing, such as whether they have registered your game. 
      <P>Rather than writing a routine to save off each of these variables and 
      objects in turn, we can store them all in a single property list called 
      "gameState," and then just save and restore that single property list. It 
      might look like this: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>put gameState
-- [#player:&lt;offspring "playerobject" 2 2aae55c&gt;,¬
  #key:#red,#registered:false]</FONT></PRE>
      <P>To save the game, all we need to do is convert all the objects in the 
      gameState to property lists, and we can save it using standard text read 
      and write. We do this by stepping through all the elements of the property 
      list, and, if something is an object, we use our objectToList() routine, 
      developed above, to convert it to a sub-list. We can then save our list 
      (as a string) to a text file. <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>  --  saveGame()
  --  Saves the contents of the gameState variable
  
  <B>on saveGame</B>
  
    global gameState
    
    saveProps = [:]
    savePropCount = gameState.count
    
    repeat with looper = 1 to savePropCount
      thisPropertyName = getPropAt(gameState,looper)
      thisPropertyValue = getAProp(gameState,thisPropertyName)
      if (objectp(thisPropertyValue)=true) then
        objstring = objectToList(thisPropertyValue)
        setAProp(saveProps,thisPropertyName,objstring)
      else
        setAProp(saveProps,thisPropertyName,thisPropertyValue)
      end if
    end repeat
    
    return saveProps
    
  end savegame</FONT></PRE>
      <P>To restore the game, we read in the text, get its value() to convert it 
      back into a property list, and then step through all the properties, 
      restoring any objects using the listToObject() routine. 
      <P>You may be wondering: how do we differentiate between things that 
      should be property lists, and things that used to be objects before they 
      were converted? This is where our #scriptName property comes in handy: any 
      property list with #scriptName as a property is an object! If a property 
      list has a #scriptName property, then we convert it to an object. Here's 
      how: <PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>  --  restoreGame()
  --  Restores the contents of the 
  -- gameState variable from the text
  
  <B>on restoreGame saveText</B>
  
    global gameState
    
    gameState = value(saveText)
    gamePropCount = gameState.count
    
    repeat with looper = 1 to gamePropCount
      thisProperty = gameState[looper]
      -- We leave the property alone unless it is an object
      if (ilk(thisProperty) = #PropList) then
        if (voidp(thisProperty[#scriptname])=false) then
          gameState[looper] = listToObject(thisProperty)
        end if
      end if
    end repeat
    
  end restoreGame</FONT></PRE>
      <P>And we're done! All we need to do now is write out and read in simple 
      text files using saveGame() and restoreGame(). For example, if you were 
      using the preferences functions: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>To save the game, we setPref("savegame.txt",string(saveGame())) 
        <LI>To restore, we restoreGame(getPref("savegame.txt")) </LI></UL>
      <P>You could also use FileIO, or even post these strings to a server. This 
      would also be the place to encrypt the string to prevent people from 
      hacking your saved games, if you care.

      up</FONT></H4>
      <P>Want to try it out? Below is an example shockwave "game" that uses 
      these exact routines. Click the "What's Going On?" button for an 
      explanation.

      <P>That's about it for the scope of this article (but see <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/UD_articles/UD85.html#further">below</A> 
      for further explorations). The important part is the concept that objects 
      can be generically converted to lists and back. With that simple-seeming 
      feature, you can write generic routines for saving and restoring any 
      complicated game state you create. 
      <P>Now you can allow your players to leave your game and come back at any 
      time, picking up right where they left off. And these concepts really 
      apply to any sort of application you are writing in Lingo; anytime you 
      need to save and restore data, you can use these routines. 
      <P>Enjoy! <A name=further></A>
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further 
      Explorations</FONT></H4>
      <P>The routines provided above do have some limitations, and overcoming 
      them are left as exercises for you, although I will probably tackle them 
      in a later article. In the mean time, try improving the situation: 
      <P><B>Problem</B>: What if some of our gameState properties point at cast 
      member references? Sprites? Do we need to change any code? 
      <P><B>Solution</B>: Experiment in the message window to see if member and 
      sprite references need any special handling. 
      <P><B>Problem</B>: What if we had a gameState property called #Inventory 
      which contains a list of objects? The saveGame() and restoreGame() 
      functions only catch objects at the "top" level of the gameState list, so 
      the inventory would get corrupted when saved and restored. 
      <P><B>Solution</B>: Rewrite saveGame() and restoreGame() to recursively go 
      down through any lists to convert any objects further down. 
      <P><B>Problem</B>: What if an object has an ancestor, or a property that 
      points to another object? 
      <P><B>Solution</B>: An ancestor will (probably <B>*</B>) show up as a 
      property, so rewrite objectToList() and listToObject() to recursively go 
      down through the properties and convert any objects it finds, and 
      traversing any lists it finds. 
      <P><B>*</B> Hint: There appears to be some strange behavior regarding 
      whether or not the ancestor shows up as a property, and how the ancestor's 
      properties are accessed when the object is treated as a property list. Try 
      different syntax in the message window to investigate. 
      <P><B>Problem</B>: This one is great! Note that 'the globals' is just like 
      any other object - you can read and write to its properties (i.e. global 
      variables) as if the globals were a property list! Therefore, you could 
      restore <B>everything</B> by restoring the globals variable to its 
      original state! This requires only a slight modification. 
      <P><B>Solution</B>: Rewrite saveGame() and restoreGame() to restore the 
      globals instead of the gameState. 
      <P><B>Problem</B>: What happens when you have two objects having 
      properties that point at each other? If you use the saveGame() and 
      restoreGame() routines we've used up to this point, you'll end up with 
      four objects instead of two. (Why?) This is probably the most complex game 
      saving situation. 
      <P><B>Solution</B>: Do a pre-processing step. Before saving the objects, 
      recurse through everything and assign each object a unique identifier. 
      Then, save the object data with the identifiers, using the identifiers for 
      placement in the list hierarchy. Then, before restoring, restore all of 
      the objects, and then step through the hierarchy, inserting the objects 
      based on the identifiers.
