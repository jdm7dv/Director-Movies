      <P>Flash 4 now includes its own scripting language, called actionScript. 
      Among other things, actionScript allows you to duplicate an existing movie 
      clip within your Flash sprite, and set its size, position and variables 
      (including text fields). 
      <P>What I hope to cover in this article is the use of this feature to 
      build a set of reusable Flash sprites for dropdown list, radio and check 
      button controls. These controls will configure their appearance 
      internally, such as the number and the labels of the chooseable options, 
      depending on parameters sent to them by a simple lingo behaviour. They 
      have the advantage of needing no Xtras (Shockwave compatible IOW), being 
      small in file size and cross-platform. 
      <P>I'll use the drop down list as the example for this article, but the 
      source code for radio and checkbox controls (which work along much the 
      same lines) are included in the downloadable file. 
      <P>Please be aware that you need to be using Director 7.02 and the latest 
      version of the FlashAsset xtra for this example to work -- that's the one 
      that shipped with shockwave 7.02. If you have not already done so, find 
      this file 
      <P>on Windows 9x<BR>&lt;system 
      drive&gt;:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MACROMED\Shockwave\Xtras\Flash Asset.x32<BR>

      <P>Here is a sample Flash movie which gives a quick idea of the basic 
      components of the Flash sprite (using fixed number/values of the drop down 
      option variables.)

      <P>I'm going to assume a basic knowledge of Flash from the reader at this 
      point, including how to create button and movie clip symbols, how to name 
      an instance of a movie clip and a basic understanding of the targeting 
      syntax for Flash layers and movies. In addition to Eric Coker's article on 
      <A href="http://www.director-online.com/accessArticle2.cfm?id=367" 
      target=_top>Flash 4 text</A> within Director/Shockwave movies I'd suggest 
      you check out <A href="http://www.flashlite.net/" 
      target=_blank>http://www.flashlite.net/</A> and <A 
      href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/" target=_blank>Macromedia's 
      Flash technotes</A>. Please also see the movie Duplicate Movie Clip.fla 
      that ships with Flash 4 (in the samples folder), and Flash helpfile 
      Emulating Arrays. This article is largely derived from these 2 examples! 
      <P>The basic components needed to get our control to work are as follows: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>A<B> Director Behaviour.</B> On initialisation, the behaviour must 
        feed the Flash sprite the desired strings for its options (setting 
        variables within the sprite) and for convenience, set an additional 
        variable representing their number. It must also be able to retrieve the 
        "value" of the sprite according to the last option that was selected in 
        the pulldown menu (itself), at any time. 
        <LI><B>A Flash sprite.</B> Stripping the Flash sprite down to the very 
        basics, we need a "dropdown" button and a "template" movie clip from 
        which to duplicate the dropdown options. The Dropdown button is a 
        standard Flash "button" symbol that sends the sprite to an appropriate 
        frame. The "template" must be a movie clip with its own "instance name" 
        in the Flash sprite (this is necessary in order to duplicate it and set 
        properties and variables.) In this example, I call the instance 
        "template". This movie clip consists of a single Flash "button" symbol.. 
        The button has a settable text field of variable name "text" and 
        whatever mouse event highlighting you may care to choose. In this case I 
        use a simple blue bar to indicate a rollover. </LI></UL>
      <P>There are two essential frames in the Flash movie sprite. 
      <P>The first frame builds the dropdown menu within the sprite by 
      duplicating the appropriate number of options from the template movie, 
      setting their position and their text field variable according to the 
      number and values of the variables set by the sprite's behaviour. I call 
      this frame Dropdown. 
      <P>The second frame removes these duplicates, leaving the sprite 
      displaying its "rolled up" state. I call this frame removeDropdown. 
      <P>The button contained in our template movie clip needs to perform the 
      following actions when clicked on (These are copied to any duplicates). It 
      must change the default display (i.e. that of the "template" movie clip) 
      to that of its own text variable/display. It must also raise an event in 
      the sprite's behaviour to tell it has done so. Lastly, it must send the 
      sprite to its removeDropdown frame. While the above are the very basics, I 
      also use two additional visual elements. 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>A simple rectangular movie to "frame" the dropdown button and the 
        default/template movie. 
        <LI>Another rectangular movie to give a nice rectangular frame to the 
        dropdown menu duplicate movies. </LI></OL>
      <P>Code : Lingo behaviour 
      <P>In this case, I use the lines of a text cast member to populate a 
      temporary linear list dropDownOptionList that is then fed as a parameter 
      into the handler (setFlashvariables) that sets the drop down options in 
      the Flash sprite. 
      <P>You could use whatever means you desire to populute this list, and also 
      reset the sprites display by use of the command... 
      <P>sendsprite 
      whichSprite,#setFlashvariables,[your_linear_list_of_strings],"Default_display_string" 

      <P>Here's the behaviour ... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pMySprite,pDefault,pText,pCollapseOnmouseLeave

<B>on beginSprite me</B>

  pMySprite = sprite(the spritenum of me)
  dropDownOptionList = MakeListFromTextMember (me)
  setFlashVariables me, dropDownOptionList, pDefault
  
end beginSprite

<B>on setFlashVariables me, optionList, strDefault</B>

  pMySprite.setVariable("default",strDefault)
  temp = optionList.count
  repeat with i = 1 to temp
    pMySprite.setVariable(("dropdown" &amp; i)," " &amp; optionList[i]) 
  end repeat
  pMySprite.setVariable("no_of_dropdowns",string(temp))
  pMySprite.gotoframe(1)
  play pMySprite
  
end setFlashVariables

<B>on returndata me</B>
  put pMySprite.getVariable("default")
end returndata

<B>on mouseLeave me</B>

  if pCollapseOnmouseLeave then
    pMySprite.gotoframe("cleardropdown")
  end if
  
end mouseLeave

<B>on makeListFromTextMember me</B>

  listToReturn = [ ]
  temp = pText.text.lines.count
  
  repeat with i = 1 to temp 
    listToReturn.add(pText.text.line[i]) 
  end repeat
  
  return listToReturn 
  
end

<B>on getPropertyDescriptionList me</B>

  pdl = [:]
  
  addprop pdl, #pDefault,[comment:"enter default string ¬
    for drop down menu",#format:#string,#default:Void]
  addprop pdl, #pText,[comment:"chose text member to ¬
    populate drop down",#format:#text,#default:Void] 
  addprop pdl, #pCollapseOnmouseLeave,[comment:"menu ¬
    collapses on mouseLeave?",#format:#boolean,#default:1]

  return pdl
  
end </FONT></PRE>
      <P>The handler to pay attention to at this stage is setFlashVariables me, 
      optionList, strDefault. 
      <P>It sets a variable in the Flash sprite called default to the string 
      specified by the parameter strDefault. This is the variable that the 
      sprite will use to set its initial default display text field, and is also 
      the one that I later refer to in order to extract the Flash sprite's 
      value. (Bear with me till later on that one, please !). The handler then 
      proceeds to step through the values of the linear list fed to it as the 
      parameter "optionList", setting a series of Flash variables to the value 
      of each member of that list. 
      <P>It is important to notice that these variable names are of the form 
      dropdown1, dropdown2, dropdown3, dropdown4, etc. I use their sequentially 
      numbered nature within the Flash file to enable it to evaluate their 
      values within a "loop while" action. 
      <P>We set the Flash sprite variable no_of_dropdowns to the number of the 
      Flash variables that we just set for the dropdown options. Although it's 
      possible to count the number of variables set within the Flash sprite, 
      it's far easier to set this variable via lingo. 
      <P>Lastly, we send the sprite to its first frame and send it a play 
      command. While this is not necessary on initialisation, should you wish to 
      reset the sprite with a sendsprite command then this will ensure that its 
      properties and display are refreshed. 
      <P>I found it necessary to set Flash variables as strings; using integers 
      raised errors. Please notice that I don't include much conversion of 
      parameters to strings or related error checking in this example, since I 
      specifically use strings as parameters. Your mileage may vary if you allow 
      the sending of other data types to the control. At this point, I think 
      it's worth noting that you can set whatever variable names and values you 
      may desire within a Flash 4 sprite. If they don't already exist then they 
      will be created on the fly. 
      <P>The other important handler is returnData. This handler is called from 
      the Flash sprite (more on this later), but of course can also be called at 
      any time by use of the sendsprite command. It gets the value of the Flash 
      sprites "default" variable, in this case displaying it within the message 
      window with a simple "put" command. I'll leave it to the reader to 
      implement a more valuable use for the result according to his/her specific 
      needs. 
      <P>The mouseLeave handler deals with collapse of the dropdown menu when 
      the mouse leaves the sprite. This depends for its success on the fact that 
      I have set the ink of the Flash sprite to be background transparent. When 
      set thus, the mouseLeave event occurs whenever the cursor leaves visible 
      areas of the Flash sprite. With the sprite's background set to 
      transparent, the handler reacts only to the dynamically configured or 
      pre-set visible elements of the sprite, and not to its entirety. It sends 
      the sprite to its "removedropdown" frame, restoring the default "rolled 
      up" display. 
      <H4><FONT color=#cc0000 face="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Code : Flash 
      Sprite actionScript</FONT></H4>
      <P>Having set the initial Flash variables, it's now time to turn our 
      attention to the Flash sprite itself, and the actionScript code that 
      allows the sprite to configure itself. 
      <P>The first thing to do is to set the default display of the sprite. 
      <P>Here's the actionScript for frame 2 of the sprite.... (In my limited 
      experience, I've found that use of frame 1 to set initial parameters can 
      lead to some rather odd effects). I let the sprite initialise itself on 
      frame 1 and play on to frame 2) 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>Set Variable: "template:text" = default
Stop</FONT></PRE>
      <P>So what that does is set the variable called "text" (a settable text 
      field) in the movie clip instance called "template" (this our default 
      display/template as defined above) to the value of the variable "default". 
      Remember that our behaviour set the value of "default" to a string when 
      this sprite was initialised. It then stops the sprite, at this point in 
      its life it has done all it needs to; it loaded and displayed the default 
      value. 
      <P>A mouse up event on the initial instance of the "drop down" button 
      sends the sprite to the frame where it builds the drop down display (in 
      this case the frame called "dropdown".) 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>On (Release)
Go to and Stop ("dropdown")
End On</FONT></PRE>
      <P>(Conversely, if the spite is at its dropdown frame, the button instance 
      on that frame sends the Flash sprite to its "removedropdown" frame.) 
      <P>Here's what happens when the F4 sprite enters the frame called 
      dropdown... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>Set Variable: "counter" = 1

      <P>This is where we duplicate/position the appropriate number of movie 
      clips from the template movie, according to the variable no_of_dropdowns 
      that we set in the behaviour. 
      <P>First, we set a counter variable for our loop, named (rather 
      unimaginatively) counter. Next we enter a loop, which will continue until 
      the counter variable has reached the value of no_of_dropdowns. In each 
      iteration of this loop, we create/set a variable "newdropdown" which we 
      will use to name and refer to the duplicate of the template movie clip we 
      are about to create. Note that this needs to have a unique value for each 
      duplicate name, so we use the value of counter concatonated with a short 
      string "dd" 
      <P><IMG height=211 src="UD92_files/Image2.gif" width=261> 
      <P>Now we duplicate our default movie clip/button (remember that its 
      instance name is template). 
      <P><IMG height=272 src="UD92_files/Image3.gif" width=245> 
      <P>So, "/template" is the movie clip that we wish to duplicate. The "/" 
      tells Flash that the movie clip is a child of the current movie. We use 
      the variable that we just generated (of value dd1, dd2, dd3, dd4 etc) as 
      the name for the instance of the new duplicate. 
      <P>The depth parameter is important. If you do not use a unique value for 
      each duplicate, then all you will do is replace your previous duplicate 
      with the current one. So we use a value linearly related to the variable 
      counter, in this case counter + 1. There is a reason for this, in that the 
      higher depth parameters take the foreground of the Flash sprite, and I 
      wish to use a lower numbered depth as space for the dropdown options' 
      background rectangle. Leaving Depth 1 free lets us do just that. 
      <P>Setting the vertical position of the new duplicate is pretty easy. Just 
      work out how many duplicates you have already made (the counter value - 
      1), and set the Y position of your duplicate to (that number times the 
      height of each duplicate) + the height of the default bounding box 
      (instance name defaultbox). 
      <P>You'll notice that I've made some shortcuts here. Since the list drops 
      down, I don't need to worry about horizontal positioning. Also, I've put 
      the registation point of each movie clip at it's bottom edge. This 
      considerably simplifies the code required to set their position. I've made 
      the assumption that the top edge of the default bounding box is at Y = 0. 
      <P><IMG height=224 src="UD92_files/Image4.gif" width=249> 
      <P>Next we need to set the text that will display in the our dropdown 
      option. You evaluate the value of the variable we set initially via lingo, 
      and pass it into the ":text" variable of our new duplicate. Evaluation is 
      done using the syntax... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>Eval (expression_evaluating _to_a_variable_ name)</FONT></PRE>
      <P>...which returns the value of that variable name. Since we know the 
      naming convention we used to set our Flash variables, it's easy to 
      reconstruct our variable names as we loop through (dropdown1, dropdown2, 
      dropdown3, etc). To pass the value into a variable within a specific named 
      instance of a movie clip we use the syntax... 
      movie_instance_name:variable_name 
      <P>In this case the variable newdropdown concatenated with ":text" 
      <P><IMG height=225 src="UD92_files/Image5.gif" width=263> 
      <P>Of course we also need to increment the "counter" in readiness for the 
      next loop. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>Set Variable: "counter" = counter + 1</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Having made and positioned all our dropdowns and exited the loop, we 
      set about duplicating the template rectangle movie to use as their 
      frame/background. This proved to be one of the more troublesome parts of 
      my drop down menu. The problem that I encountered was that of scaling. The 
      line thickness of its border appears to scale with the height/width 
      property of the instance of the movie, such that taking a physically small 
      instance and scaling its height up leads to its line thickness increasing 
      to an unacceptably high level. I took the workaround option of setting its 
      original size to about 1/2 the height of the Flash sprite and setting its 
      position to be well offstage, so it will be invisible within 
      Director/Shockwave. 
      <P>It is also possible to set the visible property of a template movie to 
      false; any duplicate of it will default to being visible. If you care to 
      look into the Flash source files for my radio button/checkbox examples, 
      you'll see that I have made use of this rather handy facility in those 
      files.... 
      <P>The actionScript is largely similar to what we've just done, with the 
      exception that we need to set the height of the new duplicate. 
      Unfortunately, you can't directly set an absolute value for the height 
      property, you have to set a percentage scale of the current height. This 
      requires a little bit of calculation. I've done the code in fairly 
      "longhand" style which is hopefully clear. 
      <P>Why the little additions of 0.5 pixels here and there? One of the 
      peculiarities of the heightand width properties of Flash movie clips (as 
      measured by actionScript) is that bounding lines are measured up to the 
      middle of the lines' thickness, such that half the thickness of the line 
      is in fact displayed outside the measured Rect of the movie clip. Since 
      I'm using 1 pixel lines as a bounding rectangle I throw in the two 0.5 
      pixel adjustments (2 pixel lines would require 1 pixel adjustments, etc). 
      A workaround might be to use rectangle fills rather than lines. One of 
      those things I wish I'd known beforehand. 
      <P>Remember that when we made the "option" duplicates we left "Depth 1" 
      free for this duplicate of the dropdown background template? We use this 
      lower depth now, and it's due to another scaling issue. Resizing the 
      sprite in Director can cause thin bands of transparency to appear between 
      the drop down options. Using a filled rectangle as a background hides this 
      effect. 
      <P>A simple stop command at the end keeps the Flash sprite at its current 
      frame. 
      <P>Et Voila, we have built our drop down menu! 
      <P>Fortunately, getting rid of the dropdown menu is far simpler. An action 
      attached to the button in our "template" movie sends the sprite to the 
      frame cleardropdown, where we quite simply remove all the duplicate movie 
      clips we made on the dropdown frame. 
      <P>Since we know their name and number, it's a simple matter to step 
      through each instance and remove it, lastly removing the dropdown surround 
      movie.

      <P>The 
      <P>first action sets the text display of our template movie to the text of 
      the option that was clicked on. The syntax "../" refers to the parent 
      movie of this movie duplicate. Likewise, our actionScript next sets the 
      variable default in the parent movie. This is the variable that we refer 
      to get the return value of the splash sprite back into director. The next 
      step is to clear the display of dropdown menu by telling (the parent of 
      this movie) to go to the frame cleardropdown. Lastly, we raise a Lingo 
      event (returndata) in the behaviour attached to the sprite, which (if you 
      check the behaviour) you will see questions the sprite for the value of 
      its default variable using "getvariable". That's how I handle the return 
      of data to the behaviour, but I must confess that I am not entirely happy 
      about the way I do it. I used the Flash default variable since it was 
      already there, and doing this also resets the display. In other cases, an 
      alternative would be to use the actionScript syntax "Get URL 
      (Flash_variable)" and catch it with the lingo handler.

      <P>That pretty well ends the code. 
      <P>Here's an example of the 3 Flash sprites in action within a shockwave 
      movie.... 
      <P>

      <P>A sample movie is available for downlaod in <A

      format. This is a Director 7 movie 
      <P>You can customise the appearance of these controls by altering their 
      template movies in Flash, and maybe improve on the boring design I've 
      outlined here. Have a litle play..

      <P>Including font outlines in the Flash sprite makes it look nice, is 
      antialiased and is reliable, but seems to have a 21 KB file size hit. 
      There may be inconsistencies with varying machines/fonts and the size of 
      the dropdown button movies, if a font is not included. 
      <P>You will notice that there is a limit to the number of dropdowns that 
      can be displayed. This is due to the vertical size of the original Flash 
      movie, and can be overcome by simply increasing its depth. It would be 
      possible to add a "scroll bar" to scroll through a longer list of options, 
      but I'm going to leave that one until I have a pressing need to do so, or 
      some kind person posts the code. Likewise, there is a limit to the length 
      of the strings that can be displayed due to the width of the movie, the 
      solution being to make everything a bit wider! 
      <P>
      <P>As with all examples on DOUG, you are free to use any of these examples 
      in your projects (commercial or otherwise), but please do email me to tell 
      me so and preferably include my name and email in your credits. 
      <P>Hope that's useful. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
