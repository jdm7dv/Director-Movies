      <P>We are trying to create a screensaver which moves to a different 
      section either every month or on specific dates. We are graphic designers 
      not Lingo specialists but we need to know if a simple lingo script could 
      produce this. For example jumping to a particular marker in a movie with 
      relevant images for Christmas etc. Can you help or point me in the right 
      direction? 
      <P><A href="mailto:sean.conroy@sage.com">Sean Conroy</A> 
      <P>Dear Sean, 
      <P>Director 7 has some nifty new date functions which are ideal for this 
      type of application. They all hinge around the built-in property call the 
      systemDate. In the message window (or any Lingo script) you can simply 
      refer to the systemDate, and it will use whatever date the computer's 
      operating system is set to. Try this in your message window (of course, 
      the date will vary based on when you're doing this.) 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>today = the systemDate
put today
-- date( 1999, 11, 5 )
put today.month
-- 11
put today.day
-- 5
put today.year
-- 1999</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Or, if you're not happy using Director 7's new dot syntax, you can 
      refer to the properties like this... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>today = the systemDate
put the month of today
-- 11
put the day of today
-- 5
put the year of today
-- 1999</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Now that we know we can find out the date, let's see how we can apply 
      that to your situation. I'm going to assume that since you're a graphic 
      artist, the calendar pages are graphics and we won't need to do any real 
      calendar functions. Also, rather than use a script that swaps a bunch of 
      cast members, we'll keep it simple: the date will direct us to a frame 
      marker. 
      <P>

      <P>A sample movie is available for download in <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/handy104.hqx">Mac</A> or 
      <A href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/other/handy104.zip">PC</A> 
      format. This is a Director 7 movie. 
      <P>For our example, we'll have 4 holidays: Christmas (Dec 25), New Year's 
      Eve (Dec 31), Halloween (Oct 31), and Groundhog Day (Feb 2). I included 
      New Year's Eve so that we'd have an example of 2 holidays in the same 
      month. If it's any other date, then the movie will simply default to the 
      frame showing the entire month. 
      <P>We obviously want the calendar to go immediately to the correct frame, 
      so we'll put our script in a startMovie handler. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on startMovie</B>

  today = the systemDate
  theDay = today.day
  thisMonth = today.month
  
  case thisMonth of
    1: go to frame "Jan"
    2: 
      if theDay = 2 then
        go to frame "GroundhogDay"
      else
        go to frame "Feb"
      end if
    3: go to frame "Mar"
    4: go to frame "Apr"
    5: go to frame "May"
    6: go to frame "Jun"
    7: go to frame "Jul"
    8: go to frame "Aug"
    9: go to frame "Sep"
    10: 
      if theDay = 31 then
        go to frame "Halloween"
      else
        go to frame "Oct"
      end if
    11: go to frame "Nov"
    12: 
    
      if theDay = 25 then
        go to frame "Christmas"
      else if theDay = 31 then
        go to frame "NewYearsEve"
      else
        go to frame "Dec"
      end if
      
  end case
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>All this script does it grab the system date, assign values for theDay 
      and theMonth, and then check those values to give the command to go to the 
      right frame. 
      <P>There's one other script I'm using here, which simply puts the date 
      into a field or text member. Instead of using the systemDate though, I'm 
      going to use an older Lingo property called the long date. The long date 
      returns the date, but it is in string format and includes the day of the 
      week and the month's name (rather than just the month's number.) Here's 
      the behavior that you can drop on any field or text member. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>on beginSprite me
  myMem = sprite(me.spriteNum).member
  myMem.text = the long date
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Good luck with your calendar programs. You might also want to check out 
      the great Text member calendar behavior that James Newton wrote. It's in 
      the Director 7 behavior library.
