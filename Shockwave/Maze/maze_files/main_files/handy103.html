      <P>I am working on a maze game. I need to make the character control by 
      four arrow keys (left, right, up and down ). How do i make the character 
      move inside the maze without working through the wall? Thank you for your 
      help! 
      <P><A href="mailto:pei-chen@rumpustoys.com">Pat</A> 
      <P>Dear Pat, 
      <P>I've received several similar maze movement questions, so I'll try to 
      show you a couple of approaches. I hope you'll pardon my simplistic 
      graphics and poor maze design. 
      <P>

      <P>Here's an example where the maze is static and the character moves 
      around by pressing the J, L, I, and K keys. I don't use the arrow keys 
      because in Shockwave on some browsers, the arrow keys are reserved for 
      browser functions so that's not dependable. As you'll see by pressing 
      those keys, the "character" (light green dot) moves around the maze, 
      stopping when it bumps into a wall. Here's how I did it. 
      <P>The walls are quickdraw sprites, all from a single cast member. Each 
      wall, including the four outside boundaries, is a separate sprite. Of 
      course, it would be easier to create a beautiful graphic maze in Photoshop 
      and then import that as a single cast member and have it in a single 
      sprite channel. However, in order to detect when the character bumps into 
      a wall, I need to have each wall as a separate sprite. You'll see why in a 
      moment. 
      <P>The character sprite has a behavior I call mazeMan. When the sprite is 
      initiated (beginSprite), it sends out a call to all the other sprites to 
      add their bounding rects to a list, pRectList. (For any sprite, the rect 
      is the rectangle which is the outer boundary of the sprite.) So mazeMan 
      compiles this list of the boundaries of all the walls. When the key is 
      pressed, the mazeMan behavior figures out the next place that the 
      character should move, then checks in the list to see if it will intersect 
      with any of the rects in the list. If an intersection is found, that means 
      it would cross a wall boundary, so the character stops. However, if no 
      intersection is found, then the character moves to the new spot. 
      <P>That's the concept, now let's get to the code. Since we're using the 
      keys to move this character around, we'll need to write a keyDownScript. 
      You can't use a keyDown handler within a behavior for mazeMan because 
      keyDown events are only recognized within movie scripts, or in behavior 
      scripts for editable fields or text. So we'll set up a movie script (we'll 
      use the startMovie script) which sets the keyDownScript to "passKeyEvent" 
      -- that's just a name I made up for a custom handler. The passKeyEvent 
      handler simply sends out a message to the mazeMan sprite, telling it to 
      pay attention to the key that was pressed (getKey). I use a global 
      variable, gMazeMan, to hold the number of the mazeMan sprite. You'll see 
      in the mazeMan behavior that it sets the value of gMazeMan. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000><B>on startMovie</B>
  set the keyDownScript to "passKeyEvent"
end

<B>on passKeyEvent</B>

  global gMazeMan
  
  sendSprite gMazeMan, #getKey
  
end passKeyEvent</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Whenever a key is pressed, the keyDownScript sends a message to 
      sprite(gMazeman) and tells it to getKey. That means that our mazeMan 
      behavior will need to have a handler called getKey which will look at 
      which key was pressed and respond. 
      <P>Here's the mazeMan behavior:

  if pHDir &lt;&gt; 0 OR pVDir &lt;&gt; 0 then
  
    currentRect = pSprite.rect    
    deltaH = pHDir * pMoveIncr
    deltaV = pVDir * pMoveIncr
    deltaRect = rect(deltaH, deltaV, deltaH, deltaV)
    newRect = currentRect + deltaRect

      end if
      
    end repeat
    
    pSprite.rect = newRect
  end if
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>Special note: when you enter a frame, sprites execute their beginSprite 
      handlers in the order of the sprite channels. So, a beginSprite handler on 
      sprite 1 executes before sprite 2 gets around to instantiating its 
      behavior. For example, suppose that we put our mazeMan in sprite 1 and 
      then put all of our maze wall sprites in the higher numbered channels. 
      When mazeMan executes its beginSprite handler, it will send out a message 
      to all sprites to reportRect. At that moment, the behaviors on the other 
      sprites aren't in existence yet, so nobody reports their rect. For this 
      exact reason, mazeMan needs to be in a higher sprite channel than any of 
      the sprite which report their rects. (If you really need mazeMan to be in 
      a lower numbered sprite channel (maybe for graphic layering reasons), then 
      you simply need to make sure that all of your maze wall sprites begin at 
      least one frame before the mazeMan sprite.) 
      <P>When mazeMan sends out the command to reportRect, all of the maze wall 
      sprites add their bounding rects to a list called pRectList. This only 
      needs to happen once, since the walls aren't moving. 
      <P>The getKey behavior simply converts the key that was pressed into 
      directional values for the character. The properties pHDir and pVDir refer 
      to the horizontal and vertical direction that the character will move. If 
      the value is 0 then the character is stopped. A value of 1 will move the 
      character to the right or down, while a value of -1 will move the 
      character up or left. The getKey handler doesn't actually move the 
      character, it simply sets the directional value which we'll soon need. 
      <P>The real meat of this behavior is the prepareFrame handler. This 
      handler executes before each new frame is drawn. Since we don't need to 
      bother doing any calculations if the character is standing still, the 
      first line checks to see if the keys have been pressed (requesting the 
      character to move.) If the values of both pHDir and pVDir are 0, then we 
      can skip the rest of the handler. 
      <P>Assuming that either pHDir or pVDir have been set to 1 or -1, then we 
      need to see if moving in that direction will cause us to intersect with a 
      wall. Start by calculating the newRect that the character <B>will have if 
      we make the move</B>. That value is computed by taking the current Rect of 
      the character sprite and adding a "deltaRect" to it. deltaRect is a bogus 
      variable which simply converts the direction and increment of the move 
      into a rect format so that it can be added to currentRect. This yields the 
      value newRect. The next step is to check to see if newRect intersects with 
      any of the wall sprite rects in pRectList. If an intersection is found, 
      pHDir and pVDir are reset to 0 and the character doesn't make a move. 
      Otherwise, the character sprite's rect is set to the newRect value, which 
      has the effect of moving the sprite on the stage. 
      <P>Here's the behavior which must be attached to all of the "wall" 
      sprites. This behavior will know what to do with that command. It's a very 
      short behavior which simply adds the wall sprite's rect to the pRectList. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- attach to maze wall sprites

<B>on reportRect me, pRectList</B>
  myRect = sprite(me.spriteNum).rect
  add pRectList, myRect
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>That's all there is to this type of maze game. But, what if your game 
      has a huge maze -- many times larger than the stage? What if you want your 
      character to stay stationary in the center of the stage while the maze 
      scrolls up and down and left and right around the character? Here's an 
      example: 
      <P>
      <OBJECT classid=clsid:166B1BCA-3F9C-11CF-8075-444553540000

      <P>For this type of maze movement, we'll need to revise our concept a 
      little bit. Some parts are the same; for every move, we'll check the 
      intersection between the character's rect and the list of wall rects -- 
      and either allow the move or not. What's different here is that we'll have 
      to calculate the newRects of all of the walls in the rectList, and we'll 
      need to move all of the wall sprites (and perhaps other objects in the 
      maze) instead of the character. When this happens, we'll have to update 
      our pRectList to show the new rects of all of the walls. That means that 
      we'll have to do a lot more calculations for every move... or maybe not! 
      Ready for a little abstract thinking? 
      <P>Even though the character is stationary and the maze is moving around 
      it, the player's perception is that the character is moving through the 
      maze -- just like the first game. Why? Because the player isn't locked 
      into perceiving the world based on the rectangle defined by the stage. So, 
      let's take the same liberty and think in terms of virtual rects. 
      <P>You may have noticed that I used the same maze design for both demos 
      above. In the first case, each move required that I check mazeMan's 
      proposed newRect against the list of wall rects. Then, when the move was 
      allowed, I changed mazeMan's rect and left the pRectList as is. So why 
      wouldn't that work in the second example? From mazeMan's perspective, he's 
      in the same maze -- his world as defined by pRectList is the same. So we 
      can use exactly the same method of evaluating potential intersections. All 
      that we really need to change is what happens when a move is allowed. 
      Instead of using mazeMan's newRect to display the movement, we'll need to 
      send a message out to all of the maze sprites to moveMaze. Still foggy? 
      Hang in there and it'll become clearer. 
      <P>In this second example, we'll need to use the same startMovie and 
      passKeyEvent movie script. The maze gets set up exactly the same way, with 
      each wall being a separate sprite. If you're going to have a huge maze, 
      set your stage size to be huge, set up the maze, then reset your stage 
      size down to the final dimension and place mazeMan at the center of that. 
      (Don't forget to set up walls around the perimeter of the maze.) In this 
      second demo, I created a background or "floor" for the maze so that you 
      can always tell if the maze is moving underneath the character -- even 
      when the walls appear the same from frame to frame. This brings up an 
      important point. 
      <P>There will probably be some objects within the maze which need to move 
      with the maze, but with which the character should be allowed to 
      intersect. Obviously, the red brick floor of the maze will be in constant 
      intersection with mazeMan. And we'll probably want to put traps and 
      potions and monsters and gold throughout the maze. They'll all need to 
      move with the maze while allowing the character to move over them for 
      collection or a fight or whatever. Therefore, we'll need two separate 
      behaviors for the maze objects/walls. The first behavior is the same one 
      we used before: reportRect. But that one will only go on objects like the 
      walls which are barriers. The second behavior is the one which will 
      actually move the sprite in unison with all the others: mazeMover. There's 
      not much to it really... 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pSprite

<B>on beginSprite me</B>
  pSprite = sprite(me.spriteNum)
end

<B>on moveMaze me, deltaH, deltaV</B>
  pSprite.loc = pSprite.loc + point((deltaH * -1), ¬
    (deltaV * -1))
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>So add the mazeMover behavior to all of the objects and walls in the 
      maze (but not to mazeMan of course.) 
      <P>Let's look at the needed revisions to the mazeMan (static) behavior. 
      You'll notice that I've changed some of the properties. We no longer need 
      to move the mazeMan sprite, so I don't bother with the pSprite property. 
      But we'll need to keep track of the virtual rect of mazeMan, so there's a 
      new property called pMyVrect. I've also renamed pRectList to pVRectList -- 
      just for clarity. 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>property pVRectList, pMoveIncr, pRIGHTkey, pLEFTkey

    end repeat
    
    pMyVrect = newVrect
    sendAllSprites(#moveMaze, deltaH, deltaV)
    
  end if
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>It looks almost identical to our previous mazeMan behavior. The 
      alterations are mainly in the prepareFrame handler. In this new behavior, 
      the newVrect (new virtual rect) is calculated by adding the deltaRect to 
      our pMyVrect value. This value is checked against the rectList as before. 
      But if the move is allowed, we see the major difference in the two 
      behaviors -- see the last few lines of the prepareFrame handler. In the 
      first mazeMan behavior, the rect of the mazeMan sprite is set to the new 
      rect. But in this new mazeMan, only the pMyVrect gets the new value, and 
      the character on stage doesn't move. Instead, a command is sent out to all 
      sprites to #moveMaze. The mazeMover behavior we applied to all of the 
      maze's walls and objects receives the message and moves its sprite 
      accordingly. 
      <P>That's the nuts and bolts! Now you can take the concept and add some 
      fun stuff. For example, you could create a behavior for object collection, 
      which would be sort of like the rectList except that intersection wouldn't 
      cause a stop. Instead, intersection would result in a reward or penalty. 
      If you get really ambitious, you'll read over the maze monster article I 
      did a few weeks ago and adapt it so that monsters can move through a 
      moving maze. Don't ask me to do it for you!
