      <P>Thank you for your article on <A 
      href="http://www.director-online.com/howTo/handy_articles/handy103.html">the 
      maze game</A>. I was able to create my own maze game for my masters class. 
      At the moment I want to place invisible rollovers to play a puppet sound 
      intersection. How can I do this? 
      <P><A href="mailto:neilf@parsons.edu">Neil </A>
      <P>Dear Neil, 
      <P>I'm not sure what you mean by invisible rollovers. Rollovers refer to 
      the mouse rolling over something, but the maze game doesn't use the mouse. 
      If you're looking for sound effects to play when the mazeMan "steps" on 
      something, that's not a rollover. Since we can't use the built in rollOver 
      event, let's create our own event called "stepOn". While we're at it, we 
      might as well create a stepOff event as well. 
      <P>We can now use the stepOn and stepOff events to trigger any number of 
      occurences. For starters, we'll have it trigger a sound playing. You could 
      have many similar behaviors in a game -- some which add or deduct points 
      or time, others which trigger booby-traps, or perhaps even a worm-hole 
      transport to another spot in the maze. Creating the behaviors like this 
      means that we don't have to limit their use to invisible sprite... they 
      can go on any sprite. 
      <P>If you do want to have the trigger sprites invisible, use the tool 
      palette to make an outline rectangle (shape cast member) on the stage. You 
      can use a single shape cast member in multiple sprite channels -- no need 
      to create a separate one for each sprite instance. Once you've positioned 
      them, with the rectangle sprite selected, use the tool palette to make the 
      line weight 0. Voila! It's invisible. For this demo, I'm not going to turn 
      the rectangular sprite invisible. That way you'll be better able to 
      observe the behavior in action. 
      <P>

      format. This is a Director 7 movie. 
      <P>Let's think about the behaviors we're going to need. For maximum 
      flexibility, we'll create one behavior called "stepOn Sensor" which checks 
      for the intersection of its own sprite and the mazeMan sprite. This sensor 
      behavior can send out the stepOn or stepOff message to other behaviors 
      which don't have to think about that intersection stuff. They simply 
      execute their tasks when tehy receive the stepOn or stepOff event command. 

      <P>The stepOn Sensor will need to repeatedly compare its sprite's rect 
      with the mazeMan sprites rect. When an intersection occurs, it will send 
      out the stepOn event command. But when mazeMan steps onto this sprite, it 
      will likely remain there for several frames. We don't want the stepOn 
      command to be repeatedly sent out for the duration of the intersection -- 
      only when the stepOn first occurs. We can use a pStatus property to keep 
      track of that. Here's the behavior: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- stepOn Sensor Behavior
-- copyright © 1999, ZZP Online, LLC
-- use in conjunction with mazeMan and mazeMover behaviors

global gMazeMan
property pStatus, pSprite, spriteNum, pMazeManSprite

<B>on beginsprite me</B>

  pSprite = sprite(me.spriteNum)
  pMazeManSprite = sprite(gMazeMan)
  pStatus = #clear
  
end beginSprite

<B>on exitFrame me</B>

  myRect = pSprite.rect
  mazeManRect = pMazeManSprite.rect
  
  if intersect(myRect, mazeManRect) &gt; 0 then
    if pStatus = #clear then
      pStatus = #stepOn
      sendSprite(spriteNum, #stepOn)
    end if
  else
    if pStatus = #stepOn then
      pStatus = #clear
      sendSprite(spriteNum, #stepOff)
    end if
  end if
  
end</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The pStatus property allows me to send out the event commands only 
      once. If this isn't intuitive to you, spend a bit of time thinking about 
      the logic. This concept has many applications, so it's worth taking the 
      time to understand. 
      <P>Using this behavior, what will happen when mazeMan steps on this 
      sprite? The behavior sends out a message to all other behaviors on the 
      same sprite. And that's it. This behavior doesn't play any sound or have 
      any other action which is apparent to the user. Its only job is to watch 
      for stepOn and stepOff and then forward those events to other behaviors. 
      Now, let's make some of those other behaviors. We'll start with sound. 
      <P>For maximum flexibility, we'll create a behavior which allows the 
      author to specify a separate sound member and sound channel for stepOn and 
      stepOff. We'll also add the option for the sound to play only on the first 
      stepOn or stepOff. For example, this might be useful when applied to a 
      sprite representing a pile of gold. The first time the mazeMan steps on 
      it, we hear a "ch-ching" sound effect. But once the player has collected 
      the gold, it won't make any sound on subsequent intersections. 
      <P>Here's the gpdl dialog box and the code:

      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- stepOn Sound Behavior

  pdlist = [:]

  return pdlist
  
end getPropertyDescriptionList</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The getPropertyDescriptionList handler looks intimidating (it's not 
      really), but the stepOn and stepOff handlers are pretty straightforward. 
      If the user has checked the box to play a sound on stepOn, then the 
      pPlayStepOn property is TRUE and the pOnSound plays in the pOnChannel. The 
      stepOff handler is the same. The only tricky part is the pFirstStepOnOnly 
      property. If the user has checked to play the sound the first time only, 
      then pFirstStepOnOnly is TRUE. After the sound plays once, the pPlayStepOn 
      (or pPlayStepOff) property gets set to NOT(pFirstStepOnOnly) -- which 
      would be FALSE, so it won't play on subsequent stepOn (or stepOff) 
      occasions. 
      <P>To see how all of this appears to the user, reset the demo movie and 
      move mazeMan to the left and down. The gold coins have the stepOn Sound 
      behavior set such that it will play a stepOn sound only the first time, 
      but will play the stepOff sound indefinitely. In contrast, if you move up 
      to the right and hook around, the small black rectangle will play on the 
      stepOn event only (not stepOff), but it will play on every stepOn, not 
      just the first time. 
      <P>For a variation, I created another behavior for the other pile of gold 
      coins at the bottom of the maze. I call it stepOn Vanish. This behavior 
      moves the sprite offstage (locH = 2000), and allows you to select whether 
      this should happen on stepOn or stepOff. Here's that code: 
      <P><PRE><FONT color=#cc0000>-- stepOn Vanish Behavior
-- copyright © 1999, ZZP Online, LLC
-- use with stepOn Sensor behavior

property pSprite, pEvent

<B>on stepOn me</B>
  if pEvent = #stepOn then
    sprite(me.spriteNum).locH = 2000
  end if
end stepOn

<B>on stepOff me</B>
  if pEvent = #stepOff then
    sprite(me.spriteNum).locH = 2000
  end if
end stepOff

<B>on getPropertyDescriptionList me</B>

  set pdlist to [:]
  
  addprop pdlist, #pEvent, [#comment:"Which event?", #format:¬
    #symbol, #default:#stepOn, #range:[#stepOn,#stepOff]]
  
  return pdlist
  
end getPropertyDescriptionList</FONT></PRE>
      <P>The possibilities are virtually endless now that we have the stepOn 
      Sensor behaviors. With this as the model, see what other custom events you 
      can create -- and for flexibility and reuse, remember to keep the event 
      separate from the resulting action. Good luck with your game!
