<H1>Message Size Notes</H1>
<P>by Dave Simmons 
<P>When making a multiuser movie, it's important to consider the size of the 
messages being sent between systems. This TechNote describes how to roughly 
calculate the number of bytes in each message.
<P>Knowing the size of messages being sent and received by your movie can help 
prevent bottlenecks. You might consider, for example, sending messages less 
frequently or broadcasting data together to lower network traffic. 
<P>In general, fewer large messages work much better than more small messages. 
This is both due to decreased network overhead (less message header data being 
sent) and fewer messages to process in your lingo code.
<P>Each message consists of the error code, server time stamp, subject, sender, 
recipient list and contents. There is also some additional message formating 
information. To get the message size, total all the components of the message 
and add another 16 bytes or so.
<P>Here's some quick guidelines for the size of content values: 
<UL>
  <LI>Integers - 4 bytes 
  <LI>Floats - 8 bytes 
  <LI>Strings - the number of characters, rounded up to an even number, plus 4 
  <LI>Symbols - the text representation size (when it looks like a string) 
  <LI>Lists - total of all the elements, plus 4 
  <LI>Properties - symbol size plus the value size 
  <LI>Points &#8211; the total of the size of the two numbers, floats or integers 
  <LI>Rects &#8211; the total of the size of the four numbers, floats or integers 
  <LI>Media or Picture of member&#8211; actual memory resident size of the object in 
  Director </LI></UL>
<P>This is an example of a chat message that might be sent from a movie: 
<TABLE width="100%" border=1>

    <TD width="56%">"What is the weather like ?"</TD>
    <TD width="8%">30</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD width="36%">
      <P>Total number of bytes</P></TD>
    <TD width="56%">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD width="8%">90</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>To look at the message traffic on the server, you must consider how large the 
messages are, how often they are sent, and how they are distributed from the 
server. 
<P>The formula for the byte rate passing the server is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>msgRate = Rate of messages, in messages per second, per movie</P>
  <P>bytesPerMsg = Number of bytes per message</P>
  <P>groupSize = Group size the message is being distributed to</P>
  <P>numUsers = Total number of users connected to the movie</P>
  <P>Total bytes/second at the server = numUsers * msgRate * bytesPerMsg * 
  (groupSize + 1)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "+ 1" in the formula takes in account that the message is sent to the 
server and then redistributed to all the members in the group.
<P>For our chat example, let's assume each user sends out a message every 20 
seconds. The chat messages look like the one above, about 100 bytes each. Assume 
there is an average of 8 people in each chat group, and 65 people logged on 
total. That gives a traffic rate at the server of: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>65 * 1/20 * 100 * (8 + 1) = 2925 bytes per second</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the client end, the formula for messages traffic is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Total bytes/second at the client = (groupSize + 1) * msgRate * 
  bytesPerMsg.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "+1" in the formula takes in account that messages sent to the server are 
relayed and sent back to the same client. 
<P>In our above example, this means the data rate is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(8 + 1) * 1/20 * 100 = 45 bytes per second.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For both cases, the data will not be a steady flow be come in somewhat random 
patterns. There will be peaks and lows in the data rate, raising and lowering 
the amount of information passing through the data pipe.</P>
